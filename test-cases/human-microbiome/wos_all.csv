J,"Greslehner, Gregor P.; Lemoine, Mael",A dual decomposition strategy of both microbial and phenotypic components for a better understanding of causal claims,BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY,English,Article,Microbiome; Causality; Decomposition; Phenotype,HALLMARKS,"In our commentary on Lynch et al.'s target paper (Biol Philos, 2019. 10.1007/s10539-019-9702-2), we focus on decomposition as a research strategy. We argue that not only the presumptive microbial causes but also their supposed phenotypic effects need to be decomposed relative to each other. Such a dual decomposition strategy ought to improve the way in which causal claims in microbiome research can be made and understood.","[Greslehner, Gregor P.; Lemoine, Mael] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR5164, ImmunoConcept, Bordeaux, France",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmeEuropean Research Council (ERC) [637647-IDEM],Many thanks to Thomas Pradeu and the ImmunoConcept group.

Moreover, such fertilizers may also result in a major public health hazard: increased antibiotic resistance. This article discusses the critical implications of perturbations in N cycle caused by excessive use of fertilizers and resulting policy implications as they relate to ecosystem services. While there are solutions such as cover crops, these solutions are expensive and inconvenient for farmers. We advocate the use of biological fixation (BF) for staple crops-microbiome mediated natural supply of fixed N. This would involve engineering a microbiome that can be grown cheaply and at industrial scale. Fertilizers resulting from such innovation are termed as ""biofertilizers"" in this article. Following a qualitative cost-benefit analysis broken down by key stakeholders and a quick exploration of policy frameworks as they relate to the advancement of biofertilizers, we propose a practical pathway of where and how research investments should be directed to make such a solution feasible. We make five policy recommendations for decision-makers to facilitate a successful trajectory for this solution: (1) Future agricultural science should seek to understand how BF might be employed as a practical and efficient strategy. This effort would require that industry and the government partner to establish a pre-competitive research laboratory equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technologies that conduct metagenomic experiments to reveal signature microbiomes and form novel symbiotic connections. (2) To have a smooth ride in the market, ag-bio companies should: (i) create awareness among farmers; (ii) impart skills to farmers in testing and using biofertilizers, and (iii) conduct extensive field tests and more research in studying the scalability potential of such fertilizers. (3)The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state governments should provide research and development (R&D) tax credits to biotech companies specifically geared towards R&D investments aimed at increasing the viability of BF and microbiome engineering. (4) To control agricultural pollution in the biosphere, federal governments should consider passing a Clean Agriculture Act (CAA), including a specific clause that regulate the use of chemical fertilizers. (5) Governments and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should coordinate Biological Advanced Research in Agriculture (BARA)-a global agricultural innovation initiative for investments and research in biological fixation and ethical, legal, and social implications of such innovation. While biological fixation will be central in BARA, we envision it to conduct research around other agricultural innovations as well, such as increasing photosynthetic efficiency.

However, the role of brain-gut axis in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on an anhedonia-like phenotype in adult mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Methods: Using CSDS paradigm, we investigated the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on the resilience versus susceptibility in mice. Results: Treatment with an antibiotic cocktail for 14 days significantly decreased the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut. Proteobacteria were markedly increased after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. At the genus and species levels, the antibiotic-treated group exhibited marked alterations in the microbiota compared with a control group. CSDS was shown to significantly improve the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the antibiotic-treated group. CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the antibiotic-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in control mice, suggesting that gut bacteria are essential for the development of CSDS-induced anhedonia. CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 or the expression of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95 and G1uA1, in the prefrontal cortex of antibiotic-treated mice. Limitations: Specific microbiome were not determined. Conclusions: These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut axis plays a role in resilience versus susceptibility to stress.","[Wang, Siming; Qu, Youge; Chang, Lijia; Pu, Yaoyu; Zhang, Kai; Hashimoto, Kenji] Chiba Univ, Div Clin Neurosci, Ctr Forens Mental Hlth, Chiba 2608670, Japan","Smoking Research Foundation, Japan; AMED, Japan [JP19dm0107119]; Japan China Sasakawa Medical Fellowship (Tokyo, Japan); TAKASE Scholarship Foundation (Tokyo, Japan)","This study was supported by Smoking Research Foundation, Japan (to K.H.), and AMED, Japan (to K.H., JP19dm0107119).

This review provides a summary on the role of gut microbiota in various neurological disorders including neurotoxicity induced by environmental stressors such as drugs, environmental contaminants, and dietary factors. We propose that the gut microbiome remotely senses and regulates CNS signaling through the following mechanisms: 1) intestinal bacteria-mediated biotransformation of neurotoxicants that alters the neuro-reactivity of the parent compounds; 2) altered production of neuro-reactive microbial metabolites following exposure to certain environmental stressors; 3) bi-directional communication within the gut-brain axis to alter the intestinal barrier integrity; and 4) regulation of mucosal immune function. Distinct microbial metabolites may enter systemic circulation and epigenetically reprogram the expression of host genes in the CNS, regulating neuroinflammation, cell survival, or cell death. We will also review the current tools for the study of the gut-brain axis and provide some suggestions to move this field forward in the future.","[Dempsey, Joseph L.; Little, Mallory; Cui, Julia Yue] Univ Washington, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","United States National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 ES007032-39, RO1GM111381, R01ES019487, R01ES025708]; University of Washington Interdisciplinary Center of for Exposures, Diseases, and Environment (EDGE) [P30ES007033]; University of Washington Department of Exposure and Occupational Health Sciences Sheldon Murphy Endowment","This work is supported by the United States National Institute of Health grants T32 ES007032-39, RO1GM111381, R01ES019487, and R01ES025708, the University of Washington Interdisciplinary Center of for Exposures, Diseases, and Environment (EDGE) (P30ES007033), and the University of Washington Department of Exposure and Occupational Health Sciences Sheldon Murphy Endowment.",1,DEC,2019,75,,10.1016/j.neuro.2019.08.005,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology

The urban environment differs greatly from that in which humans evolved, with potentially important consequences for health. Rates for allergic, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases appear to rise with urbanization and be higher in the more urbanized nations of the world which has led some to suggest that cities promote the occurrence of these diseases. However, there are no syntheses outlining what urban-associated diseases are and what characteristics of cities promote their occurrence. Objectives: To synthesize the current understanding of ""urban-associated diseases"", and discover the common, potentially modifiable features of cities that may be driving these associations. Methods: We focus on any diseases that have been associated with cities or are particularly prominent in today's urban societies. We draw on expertise across diverse health fields to examine the evidence for urban connections and drivers. Discussion: We found evidence for urban associations across allergic, auto-immune, inflammatory, lifestyle and infectious disease categories. Some conditions (e.g. obesity and diabetes) have complex relationships with cities that have been insufficiently explored. Other conditions (e.g. allergies and asthma) have more evidence demonstrating their relationship with cities and the mechanisms driving that association. Unsurprisingly, air pollution was the characteristic of cities most frequently associated with disease. Other identified urban risk factors are not as widely known: altered microbial exposure and a disconnect from environmental microbiomes, vitamin D deficiency, noise and light pollution, and a transient, over-crowded, impoverished population. However, many complexities and caveats to these relationships beg clarification; we highlight the current knowledge gaps and outline ways to fill those gaps. Identifying urban-associated diseases and their drivers will allow us to prepare for the urban-disease burden of the future and create healthy cities that mitigate that disease burden.","[Flies, Emily J.; Brook, Barry W.; Buettel, Jessie C.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Coll Sci & Engn, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Mavoa, Suzanne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zosky, Graeme R.] Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Zosky, Graeme R.] Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Mantzioris, Evangeline] Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Mantzioris, Evangeline] Univ South Australia, ARENA, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Williams, Craig] Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Eri, Rajaraman] Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Sch Hlth Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FL160100101],We are very grateful for feedback from Prof. David Vlahov on a draft of this piece; Prof. Vlahov's thoughtful and expert critique strengthened our final manuscript.

To evaluate these causal claims, we first examine a well-known single-microbe causal explanation: of Helicobacter pylori causing ulcers. This apparently straightforward causal explanation is not so simple, however. It does not achieve a key explanatory standard in microbiology, of Koch's postulates, which rely on manipulations of single-microorganism cultures to infer causal relationships to disease. When Koch's postulates are framed by an interventionist causal framework, it is clearer what the H. pylori explanation achieves and where its explanatory strengths lie. After assessing this 'simple', single-microbe case, we apply the interventionist framework to two key areas of microbiome research, in which obesity and mental health states are purportedly explained by microbiomes. Despite the experimental data available, interventionist criteria for explanation show that many of the causal claims generated by microbiome research are weak or misleading. We focus on the stability, specificity and proportionality of proposed microbiome causal explanations, and evaluate how effectively these dimensions of causal explanation are achieved in some promising avenues of research. We suggest some conceptual and explanatory strategies to improve how causal claims about microbiomes are made.","[Lynch, Kate E.] Univ Sydney, Dept Philosophy, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lynch, Kate E.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lynch, Kate E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Parke, Emily C.] Univ Auckland, Sch Humanities, Philosophy, Auckland, New Zealand; [O'Malley, Maureen A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Hist & Philosophy Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,2,DEC,2019,34,6,10.1007/s10539-019-9702-2,History & Philosophy Of Science

However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome composition is associated with the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and relief from clinical symptoms in patients. Methods: Stool samples from 36 patients with active GAD (A-GAD group) and 24 matched healthy control subjects (HC group) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and global assessments of functioning were performed at baseline and 1 month after drug treatment. Results: Gut microbiome compositions were altered in A-GAD patients, with fewer operational taxonomic units and lower fecal bacterial alpha-diversity. Specifically, Firmicutes and Tenericutes abundances were lower in A-GAD patients, and several genera were differentially represented in the A-GAD and HC groups. The abundances of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated negatively with the anxiety severity and positively with anxiety reduction, whereas the abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella were positively associated with anxiety severity. Sex, smoking, and alcohol intake influenced the gut microbiome composition. Limitations: The sample sizes were small and the stool samples were collected only at baseline; therefore, a causal association between changes in intestinal flora and disease remission was not established. Moreover, the effects of different drugs on gut microbiome composition were not investigated. Conclusions: Altered gut microbiome composition may contribute to GAD pathogenesis and remission.","[Chen Yi-huan; Bai Jie; Wu Di; Yu Shou-fen; Qiang Xiao-ling; Wang Hua-ning; Peng Zheng-wu] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Xijing Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 15 Changle Rd, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Bai Hua] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Xijing Hosp, Dept Emergency, 15 Changle Rd, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81630032, 81571309]; National Science and Technology Support Program of China [2015BAI13B00];  [165518]","We would like to thank Huifang An from Sinotech Genome Technology Co., Ltd. for the 16S rRNA sequencing-data analysis and language editing services from Elsevier (Project number: 165518).

Bedroom floor dust was collected at age 3 months and 4 bacterial and fungal diversity measures [number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices] were calculated from Illumina MiSeq sequencing data. Hyperactivity/inattention was based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at ages 10 and 15 (cut-off >= 7). Adjusted associations between 4 diversity measures in tertiles and hyperactivity/inattention were investigated with weighted and survey logistic regression models. We included 226 individuals with information on microbial diversity and hyperactivity/inattention. Early life bacterial diversity was inversely associated with hyperactivity/inattention at age 10 [bacterial OTUs (medium vs low: aOR = 0.4, 95%CI = (0.2-0.8)) and Chao1 (medium vs low: 0.3 (0.1-0.5); high vs low: 0.3 (0.2-0.6)], whereas fungal diversity was directly associated [Chao1 (high vs low: 2.1 (1.1-4.0)), Shannon (medium vs low: 2.8 (1.3-5.8)), and Simpson (medium vs low: 4.7 (2.4-9.3))].

Here we use ancient DNA extraction methods, shotgun library preparation, and next generation Illumina sequencing to examine oral microbiota from 19 dental calculus samples recovered from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) who died in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. The resulting sequences were trimmed for quality, analyzed using MALT, MEGAN, and alignment scripts, and integrated with previously published dental calculus microbiome data. We report significant differences in oral microbiome phyla between chimpanzees and anatomically modern humans (AMH), with chimpanzees possessing a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, and AMH showing higher Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Our results suggest that by using an enterotype clustering method, results cluster largely based on host species. These clusters are driven by Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium genera in chimpanzees and Haemophilus and Streptococcus in AMH. Additionally, we compare a nearly complete Porphyromonas gingivalis genome to previously published genomes recovered from human gingiva to gain perspective on evolutionary relationships across host species. Finally, using shotgun sequence data we assessed indicators of diet from DNA in calculus and suggest exercising caution when making assertions related to host lifestyle. These results showcase core differences between host species and stress the importance of continued sequencing of nonhuman primate microbiomes in order to fully understand the complexity of their oral ecologies.","[Ozga, Andrew T.; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolut & Med, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Ozga, Andrew T.; Gilby, Ian; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Ozga, Andrew T.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Gilby, Ian; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Nockerts, Rebecca S.; Wilson, Michael L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anthropol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Wilson, Michael L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 318 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pusey, Anne] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC USA","Strategic Initiative Funds, Office of the President, Arizona State University; Center for Evolution and Medicine postdoctoral fellowship at Arizona State University; Leakey Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1548562]","We acknowledge members of the Gombe research team including Anthony Collins, Dismas Mwacha, Deus Mjungu, and Joel Bray for their assistance in sample collection and dental documentation.

Gut microbiota play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg.bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the microbiota composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped microbiota composition. This study provides a clue for understanding the systemic mechanism of anti-depression effects of sesamin.","[Wang, Qianxu; Jia, Mengzhen; Zhao, Yihang; Pan, Junru; Yu, Hongfei; Yan, Shikai; Liu, Xuebo; Liu, Zhigang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hui, Yan] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food Sci, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hui, Yan; Dai, Xiaoshuang] BGI Shenzhen, BGI Inst Appl Agr, Shenzhen 518120, Guangdong, Peoples R China","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0400601]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81803231, 81871118]; China postdoctoral science foundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M602867, 2018T111104]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi [2018NY-100]","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2016YFD0400601), National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81803231), National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81871118), General Financial Grant from China postdoctoral science foundation (2016M602867), Special Financial Grant from China postdoctoral science foundation (2018T111104), Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi (no. 2018NY-100).",0,Nov-13,2019,67,45,10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03652,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology"

P. copri encompasses four distinct clades (>10% inter-clade genetic divergence) that we propose constitute the P. copri complex, and all clades were confirmed by isolate sequencing. These clades are nearly ubiquitous and co-present in non-Westernized populations. Genomic analysis showed substantial functional diversity in the complex with notable differences in carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that multi-generational dietary modifications may be driving reduced prevalence in Westernized populations. Analysis of ancient metagenomes highlighted patterns of P. copri presence consistent with modern non-Westernized populations and a clade delineation time pre-dating human migratory waves out of Africa.

ECC is common in many population groups in Canada. Objective: The purpose of this review was to describe the burden of ECC in Canada, the prevalence and associated risk factors for ECC, and its impact on childhood health based on the existing published literature. Methods: A review was conducted to assess published Canadian studies on ECC identified through searches of electronic databases. Databased searched included PubMed, Medline, Cinahl, and the library catalog of the University of Manitoba. Known publications on ECC that were not identified by the electronic search were also considered. Only the studies that reported the prevalence of ECC or caries in preschool aged children were considered. In-depth assessments were restricted to those studies that employed logistic regression analysis to investigate relationship between ECC and risk factors or nutritional status and quality of life. Results: A total of 36 studies were identified that related to ECC in Canadian children. Overall, 27 related to prevalence and 12 reported on risk factors, four related to the association between severe ECC and nutritional health and well-being, while only one related to the oral microbiome composition. Published studies reveal that the prevalence of ECC can be as high as 98% in some parts of Canada. Commonly identified risk factors include age, sex, socio-economic status, parental beliefs, family characteristics, debris/plaque, enamel hypoplasia, and behavioral (oral health or feeding behaviors) tendencies. Conclusions: Current literature reveals that many Canadian children are affected by ECC. The development of ECC appears to be strongly associated with social determinants of health including low household income and the level of parental education or employment status. Associations were also observed between ECC and the child's age at first dental visit and parental beliefs about child's oral health. Children with enamel hypoplasia are also at significantly greater odds for experiencing caries. Future research should include assessments of developmental defects of enamel to better understand the association between enamel hypoplasia and ECC.","[Pierce, Andrew; Singh, Sarbjeet; Lee, JuHae; Grant, Cameron; de Jesus, Vivianne Cruz; Schroth, Robert J.] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Dr Gerald Niznick Coll Dent, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Pierce, Andrew; Singh, Sarbjeet; Lee, JuHae; Grant, Cameron; Schroth, Robert J.] Childrens Hosp Res Inst Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Schroth, Robert J.] Univ Manitoba, Maxy Rady Coll Med, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",Canadian Institutes of Health Research Embedded Clinician Researcher salary award in Improving access to oral health care and oral health care delivery for at-risk young children in ManitobaCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),RS holds a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Embedded Clinician Researcher salary award in Improving access to oral health care and oral health care delivery for at-risk young children in Manitoba.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the effect of alcohol on the intestinal microbiome using the PRISMA checklist. We searched the Medline database on the PubMed platform for studies determining the effect of alcohol on microbiota in individuals with AUD. The manual search included references of retrieved articles. Only human studies examining the intestinal bacterial microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were included. Data comparing relative abundances of bacteria comprising intestinal microbiota was extracted. Results: We retrieved 17 studies investigating intestinal microbiome alterations in individuals with AUD. Intestinal microbiome alterations in individuals with AUD included depletion of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increase of Enterobacteriaceae. At the phylum level, a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and lower of Bacteroidetes were found. Mixed results regarding Bifidobacterium were obtained. Several species of short-chain fatty acids producing bacteria had a lower abundance in individuals with alcohol use disorder.

The results show that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Traffic level significantly affected the number of operational taxonomic units. Traffic level was a key factor for distinctive bacterial community in the medical center. Targeted ARGs were detected from all buildings and tetQ concentration was related with traffic level, and KPC was only detected from the medical center. Most of the floor surfaces showed the presence of dog-specific fecal bacteria (83%) followed by bird-specific fecal bacteria (75%).

Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed ""From Challenges, to Opportunities"". Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health.","[Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Perth Childrens Hosp, Telethon Kids Inst, ORIGINS Project, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Prescott, Susan L.; Logan, Alan C.] Worldwide Univ Network WUN, VIVO Planetary Hlth, West New York, NJ 10704 USA; [Hancock, Trevor] Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Policy retired, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Bland, Jeffrey] Personalized Lifestyle Med Inst, Tacoma, WA 98443 USA; [van den Bosch, Matilda] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Jansson, Janet K.] Pacific Northwestatl Lab, Div Biol Sci, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Johnson, Christine C.; Wegienka, Ganesa] Wayne State Univ, Henry Ford Hlth Syst & Ctr Urban Responses Enviro, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Kondo, Michelle] USDA Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; [Katz, David] Yale Univ, Yale Griffin Prevent Res Ctr, Derby, CT 06418 USA; [Kort, Remco] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kozyrskyj, Anita] Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Nanan, Ralph] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr Nepean, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Poland, Blake] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5T, Canada; [Robinson, Jake] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Schroeck, Nicholas] Univ Detroit Mercy, Sch Law Detroit, Mercy, MI 48226 USA; [Sinkkonen, Aki] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, Lahti 15140, Finland; [Springmann, Marco] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Wright, Robert O.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA",Danone; Genuine Health,Our meeting was funded by participants and in-kind support from collaborating academic institutions.

Little is known about the effects of probiotic supplementation on symptoms of depression and quality of life (QOL) in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Methods This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 44 patients with a recent diagnosis of MI who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either capsules containing 1.6 x 10(9) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus capsules with their lunch (the active intervention group) or capsules that contained maltodextrin (the placebo control group) for 12 weeks. The Beck Depression Inventory, QOL, and biomarkers of oxidative stress (serum total antioxidant capacity), and malondialdehyde), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as inflammation marker were assessed. These measures were obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks' follow-up. Results The total Beck Depression Inventory score decreased significantly in patients who received probiotic supplements compared with the placebo group (-5.57 [6.1] versus -0.51 [2.8], p = .045). Improvements in the mean QOL score were also stronger in the probiotic versus the placebo group (23.6 [39.1] versus 0.44 [42.6], p = .023). In addition, increases in total antioxidant capacity (93.7 [88.4] versus 27.54 [64.7] mmol/l, p = .009) and decreases in malondialdehyde (-40.7 [63.73] versus -4.2 [67.6] nmol/ml, p = .033) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-1.74 [0.70] versus 0.67 [1.27] mg/l, p = .040) levels were stronger in patients receiving probiotic supplementation than the placebo group. Conclusion These data provide preliminary evidence that probiotic supplementation in patients with percutaneous coronary intervention post-MI has beneficial effects on depressive symptoms and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are needed to replicate these findings and identify patient subgroups with the most benefit from probiotic supplementation.

Evidence is accumulating that interactions between substances in the environment and the microbiome can affect risks of disease, in both beneficial and adverse ways. Although most of the research has concerned the roles of diet and certain pharmaceutical agents, there is increasing interest in the possible roles of environmental chemicals. Chemical risk assessment has, to date, not included consideration of the influence of the microbiome. We suggest that failure to consider the possible roles of the microbiome could lead to significant error in risk assessment results. Our purpose in this commentary is to summarize some of the evidence supporting our hypothesis and to urge the risk assessment community to begin considering and influencing how results from microbiome-related research could be incorporated into chemical risk assessments. An additional emphasis in our commentary concerns the distinct possibility that research on chemical-microbiome interactions will also reduce some of the significant uncertainties that accompany current risk assessments. Of particular interest is evidence suggesting that the microbiome has an influence on variability in disease risk across populations and (of particular interest to chemical risk) in animal and human responses to chemical exposure. The possible explanatory power of the microbiome regarding sources of variability could reduce what might be the most significant source of uncertainty in chemical risk assessment.","[Rodricks, Joseph] Ramboll US Corp, 4350 N Fairfax Dr,Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Huang, Yvonne] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mantus, Ellen] Natl Acad Sci Engn & Med, Board Environm Studies & Toxicol, Washington, DC USA; [Shubat, Pamela] Minnesota Dept Hlth, Div Environm Hlth, Hlth Risk Assessment, St Paul, MN USA",NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R03 HL138310]; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI129958],,1,NOV,2019,39,11,10.1111/risa.13316,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"

Yet, little is known about the intra-specific variation of chewing efficiency. The purpose of this study is to report the pattern of seasonal and regional variation in chewing efficiency among Yakushima Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). Materials and Methods Fecal samples of Yakushima Japanese macaques were collected from lowland, highland and summit areas in Yakushima between July 2015 and March 2016 (n = 236). Using sieving analysis, we compared fecal particle size (dMEAN) and proportion of finest particles p(0) between different geographical areas and seasons. Results Seasonally, in the lowland zone, there was a non-significant decrease in dMEAN during spring, while p(0) was significantly higher during summer than it was during winter and spring. Regionally, dMEAN was higher in the summit zone than it was in other areas during autumn, while p(0) was also higher in the summit zone. Conclusions While seasonal variation in dMEAN can be explained by the reported difference in the proportions of food categories in diet between seasons, its influence is mitigated, possibly by the selective feeding of less mechanically challenging parts in each category. Regional variation in dMEAN and p(0) may be the results of bamboo consumption in this area. Combining our data with studies that focus on seasonal and regional variations of food properties or gut microbes might provide a better understanding of the relation between diet, chewing and digestion in Yakushima macaques.","[He, Tianmeng; Honda, Takeaki; Kurihara, Yosuke] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Thiery, Ghislain] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Sociol & Anthropol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University; Sun Yat-sen University","Sun Yat-sen University; Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University",0,,,,,10.1002/ajpa.23955,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) suggests that visceral adipose mass (VAM) plays a predominant role, whereas non-visceral adipose mass (NVAM) and lean muscle mass (LMM) have shown conflicting relationships. It is unknown how longitudinal, cognitive changes in age-sensitive domains like fluid intelligence (FI) correspond to VAM, NVAM, and LMM in women and men. Furthermore, changes over time in blood leukocyte sub-populations may partially or fully account for sex-specific associations. Methods: Data on 4431 late middle-aged, cognitively unimpaired adults (mean = 64.5 y) was obtained from the UK Biobank prospective cohort across 22 centers. FI scores, blood leukocyte counts, and covariates (age, social class, education) were measured at three 2-year intervals over 6 years. DEXA collection overlapped with these intervals. Sex-stratified growth curves, structural equations, and Preacher-Hayes mediation were used to estimate direct and indirect effects. beta-weights were standardized. Results: More LMM predicted gains in FI scores among women (beta = 0.130, p < .001) and men (beta = 0.089, p < .001). Conversely, more VAM and NVAM independently predicted FI decline equally among sexes (e.g., NVAM: women: beta = -0.082, p < .001; men: beta = -0.076, p < .001). Among women, FI associations were fully mediated by higher eosinophil counts via VAM (lambda = 30.8%, p = .028) and lower lymphocyte counts via LMM (lambda = 69.2%, p = .021). Among men, FI associations were partially mediated by lower basophils counts via LMM (lambda = 4.5%, p = .042) and higher counts via VAM (lambda = 50%, p = .037). Conclusion: The proportion of LMM and VAM equally influenced male FI changes over 6 years, whereas higher LMM among women appeared to more strongly influence. FI changes. Leukocyte counts strongly mediated VAM- and LMM-related FI changes in a sex-specific manner, but not for NVAM. For clinical translation, exercise studies in older adults may benefit from assessing sex-specific values of DEXA-based tissue mass, FI, and leukocyte sub-populations to gauge potential cognitive benefits of less VAM and more LMM.","[Klinedinst, Brandon S.; Pappas, Colleen; Le, Scott; Wang, Qian; Willette, Auriel A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Ames, IA USA; [Klinedinst, Brandon S.; Wang, Qian; Willette, Auriel A.] Iowa State Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Ames, IA USA; [Le, Scott; Willette, Auriel A.] Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Studies Program, Ames, IA USA; [Yu, Shan; Wang, Li] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA USA; [Allenspach-Jorn, Karin; Willette, Auriel A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Ames, IA USA; [Mochel, Jonathan P.; Willette, Auriel A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA USA; [Willette, Auriel A.] Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00 AG047282, AARGD-17-529552]; Iowa State University","This study was funded by Iowa State University, NIH R00 AG047282, and AARGD-17-529552.

The extent to which these relate to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is unclear, despite anxiety being a prominent symptom of this disorder. The purpose of this analysis was to examine gastrointestinal symptoms in unmedicated, non-depressed adult OCD patients compared to age- and sex-matched community controls. Methods: Twenty-one OCD patients and 22 controls were recruited from the community (Hamilton, ON, Canada) and enrolled in this cross-sectional study. In addition to a standardized psychiatric assessment, participants completed clinician- and self-rated psychiatric and gastrointestinal symptom severity measures. Presence of IBS was assessed using Rome III criteria. Results: Gastrointestinal symptom severity (GSRS total; OCD = 8.67 +/- 6.72 vs. controls = 2.32 +/- 2.12) and prevalence of IBS (OCD = 47.6%; Controls = 4.5%) was higher in OCD patients than in controls. A comparison of OCD patients based on IBS status revealed greater depressive symptom severity (total MADRS: 12.60 +/- 1.89 vs 6.91 +/- 2.77), p < 0.001) among those with IBS. Conclusions: High prevalence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms may be an important clinical consideration when treating OCD patients. More specifically, assessment of IBS and gastrointestinal symptoms may be useful when considering pharmacotherapeutic treatments options for patients. Given the high comorbidity noted with IBS, a disorder of the ""gut-brain axis"", results may suggest a shared pathophysiological mechanism between psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders which should be explored in future research.","[Turna, Jasmine] McMaster Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine; Kaplan, Keren Grosman; Patterson, Beth; Van Ameringen, Michael] MacAnxiety Res Ctr, 1057 Main St W Suite L02, Hamilton, ON L8S 1B7, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine; Kaplan, Keren Grosman; Patterson, Beth; Anglin, Rebecca; Soreni, Noam; Van Ameringen, Michael] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Bercik, Premysl; Anglin, Rebecca] McMaster Univ, Farncombe Digest Hlth Res Inst, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine] McMaster Univ, Peter Boris Ctr Addict Res, Michael G DeGroote Ctr Med Cannabis Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Anglin, Rebecca] Univ Western Australia, Univ Notre Dame, Fiona Stanley Hosp, Sch Med, Nedlands, WA, Australia",,,0,NOV,2019,118,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.08.004,Psychiatry

As macroecologists, conservationists, and climate scientists race to document, understand, predict, and delay global changes in our wider environment, microbiota scientists may benefit by using analogous approaches to study and protect our intimate microbial ecosystems.","[Sonnenburg, Justin L.; Sonnenburg, Erica D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sonnenburg, Justin L.; Sonnenburg, Erica D.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Human Microbiome Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sonnenburg, Justin L.] Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-DK085025, DP1-AT00989201]",This work was supported by the NIH (R01-DK085025 and DP1-AT00989201).

We examined associations between micronutrient intake and a low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota as assessed by molecular methods (termed ""molecular-BV""). Methods This cross-sectional analysis utilized data collected at the baseline visit of the Hormonal Contraception Longitudinal Study, a cohort of reproductive-aged women followed over 2 years while initiating or ceasing hormonal contraception (HC). The Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire was administered and micronutrient intakes were ranked. Vaginal microbiota composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and clustered into community state types (CSTs) based on the types and relative abundance of bacteria detected. Associations between the lowest estimated quartile intake of nutrients and having a low-Lactobacillus CST (molecular-BV) were evaluated by logistic regression. Separate models were built for each nutrient controlling for age, body mass index, behavioral factors, HC use and total energy intake. We also conducted a literature review of existing data on associations between micronutrient intakes and BV. Results Samples from 104 women were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 25.8 years (SD 4.3), 29.8% were African American, 48.1% were using HC, and 25% had molecular-BV. In adjusted multivariable analyses, the lowest quartile of betaine intake was associated with an increased odds of molecular-BV (aOR 9.2, p value < 0.01, [CI 2.4-35.0]). Conclusions This is the first study to assess the association between estimated micronutrient intake and molecular-BV. Lower energy-adjusted intake of betaine was associated with an increased risk of molecular-BV. Betaine might have direct effects on the vaginal microenvironment or may be mediated through the gut microbiota. Additional research is needed to determine reproducibility of this finding and whether improved intake of select micronutrients such as betaine decreases the risk of BV and its sequelae.","[Tuddenham, Susan; Ghanem, Khalil G.; Murphy, Catherine] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, 5200 Eastern Ave,MFL Ctr Tower,Suite 381, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Caulfield, Laura E.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Human Nutr, Baltimore, MD USA; [Rovner, Alisha J.] Univ Delaware, Dept Behav Hlth & Nutr, Newark, DE USA; [Robinson, Courtney; Ravel, Jacques; Brotman, Rebecca M.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Inst Genome Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Shivakoti, Rupak] Columbia Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Miller, Ryan] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Burke, Anne] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Murphy, Catherine] Maria Fareri Childrens Hosp, New York Med Coll, Valhalla, NY USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01AI089878];  [K23AI125715],This research was supported by NIH grant R01AI089878 (PI: Ghanem).

Milk bacteria appear to, amongst others, originate from the maternal gut. A mother's postnatal psychosocial distress may alter maternal gut microbiota, which in turn may affect the bacteria present in milk. The aim of this study was to explore whether maternal postnatal psychosocial distress was related to alterations in the relative abundances of specific bacteria and to milk microbial diversity. Healthy mothers (N = 77; N = 51 with complete data) collected breast milk samples at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postpartum and filled in mood questionnaires on experienced stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. A metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA gene sequencing (region V3 and V4) using Illumina MiSeq technology) was used to assess bacterial abundances and diversity. For the group as a whole, an increase in diversity of the milk bacterial community was observed during the first 3 months of breastfeeding (Shannon index). This general increase in diversity appears to be explained by an increase of Lactobacillus and other minor genera, together with a decrease in Staphylococcus. With respect to psychological distress and milk microbial composition, no significant differences in the relative abundance of major bacterial genera were detected between women with high (N = 13) and low (N = 13) psychosocial distress. However, progressive and distinct changes in the content of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, and Lactobacillus at the genera level were observed in milk samples of women with low psychosocial distress. With respect to milk microbial diversity, high maternal psychosocial distress, compared to low maternal psychosocial distress, was related to significantly lower bacterial diversity in milk at 3 months post-delivery. Anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms separately were unrelated to specific bacterial profiles. The current study suggests a potential relation between maternal psychosocial distress and milk microbiota, providing first evidence of a possible mechanism through which post-partum psychological symptoms may affect infant development and health.","[Browne, Pamela D.; Beijers, Roseriet; de Weerth, Carolina] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Aparicio, Marina; Miguel Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Alba, Claudio; Fernandez, Leonides] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Sect Galen Pharm & Food Technol, Madrid, Spain; [Hechler, Christine; Beijers, Roseriet] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Dev Psychol, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [AGL2016-75476-R]; Jacobs Foundation; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research VENI grant [016.195.197],LF and JR's work was funded by project AGL2016-75476-R from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain).

Therefore, we performed 165 rRNA gene sequencing on rectal swab samples from 381 men who have sex with men, 48% of whom were PLWH and 41% of whom used MA. We compared microbiome composition between MA users and non-users while testing for potential interactions with HIV and controlling for numerous confounders using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that MA use explained significant variation in overall composition (R-2 = 0.005, p= 0.008) and was associated with elevated Finegoldia, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus, and Porphyromonas and reduced Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium, among others. Genera including Actinomyces and Streptobacillus interacted with HIV status, such that they were increased in HIV+ MA users. Finegoldia and Peptoniphilus increased with increasing frequency of MA use, among others. In summary, MA use was associated with a microbial imbalance favoring pro-inflammatory bacteria, including some with neuroactive potential and others that have previously been associated with poor HIV outcomes.","[Cook, Ryan R.; Javanbakht, Marjan; Gorbach, Pamina M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fulcher, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fulcher, Jennifer A.] VA Greater Angeles Healthcare Syst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Tobin, Nicole H.; Li, Fan; Lee, David J.; Woodward, Cora; Aldrovandi, Grace M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Brookmeyer, Ron] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shoptaw, Steve] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Shoptaw, Steve] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bolan, Robert] Los Angeles LGBT Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bolan, Robert] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Los Angeles, CA USA","National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [1R36 DA046310, 2U01 DA036267]; UCLA Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services (CHIPTS; National Institute of Mental Health) [P30 MH58107]; UCLA CFAR Microbiome and Mucosal Immunology Core [P30 AI028697]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [K08 AI124979]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [UM1AI068632, UM1AI068616, UM1AI106716]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); UCLA AIDS Institute","This work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (1R36 DA046310 and 2U01 DA036267) and the UCLA Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services (CHIPTS; National Institute of Mental Health P30 MH58107).

An area of fascination and great potential is the human microbiome. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota has significant roles in an individual's ability to avoid cancer, with considerable focus on the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer. That in mind, racial disparities with regard to colorectal cancer treatment and prevention are generally understudied despite higher incidence and mortality rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A comprehension of ethnic differences with relation to colorectal cancer, dietary habits and the microbiome is a meritorious area of investigation. This review highlights literature that identifies and bridges the gap in understanding the role of the human microbiome in racial disparities across colorectal cancer.

These changes impact the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with many implications for human health. Most prior studies linking biogeochemical changes to human health have evaluated the effects of single elements in isolation. However, the relative availability of multiple elements often determines the biological impact of shifts in the concentration of a single element. The balance of multiple elements is the focus of ecological stoichiometry, which highlights the importance of elemental ratios in biological function across all systems and scales of organization. Consequently, ecological stoichiometry is a promising framework to inform research on the links between global changes to elemental cycles and human health. We synthesize evidence that elemental ratios link global change with human health through biological processes occurring at two scales: in the environment (natural ecosystems and food systems) and within the human body. Elemental ratios in the environment impact the key ecosystem processes of productivity and biodiversity, both of which contribute to the production of food, toxins, allergens, and parasites. Elemental ratios in diet impact processes within the human body, including the function and interactions of the immune system, parasites, and the non-pathogenic microbiome. Collectively, these stoichiometric effects contribute to a wide range of non-infectious and infectious diseases. By describing stoichiometric mechanisms linking global change, ecological processes, and human health, we hope to inspire future empirical and theoretical research on this theme.","[Paseka, Rachel E.; See, Craig R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Bratt, Anika R.] Davidson Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Davidson, NC 28036 USA; [MacNeill, Keeley L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forestry Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Burian, Alfred] Univ Derby, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, Derby, England",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1639145]; National SocioEnvironmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO),Woodstoich 4 was supported by the National Science Foundation DEB-1840408.

Here, in an effort to improve our understanding of the human microbiome, we compare gut microbiome composition and functional potential in 14 populations of humans from ten nations and 18 species of wild, non-human primates. Results Contrary to expectations from host phylogenetics, we find that human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes. Additionally, our data reveal more inter-individual variation in gut microbiome functional potential within the human species than across other primate species, suggesting that the human gut microbiome may exhibit more plasticity in response to environmental variation compared to that of other primates. Conclusions Given similarities of ancestral human habitats and dietary strategies to those of baboons, these findings suggest that convergent ecologies shaped the gut microbiomes of both humans and cercopithecines, perhaps through environmental exposure to microbes, diet, and/or associated physiological adaptations. Increased inter-individual variation in the human microbiome may be associated with human dietary diversity or the ability of humans to inhabit novel environments. Overall, these findings show that diet, ecology, and physiological adaptations are more important than host-microbe co-diversification in shaping the human microbiome, providing a key foundation for comparative analyses of the role of the microbiome in human biology and health.","[Amato, Katherine R.; Mallott, Elizabeth K.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, 1810 Hinman Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [McDonald, Daniel; Knight, Rob] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [McDonald, Daniel; Knight, Rob] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Microbiome Innovat, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Dominy, Nathaniel J.; Britton, Gillian A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Anthropol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Goldberg, Tony] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lambert, Joanna E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Swedell, Larissa] CUNY Queens Coll, Dept Anthropol, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Metcalf, Jessica L.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Gomez, Andres] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anim Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55108 USA; [Stumpf, Rebecca M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Leigh, Steven R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Knight, Rob] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Knight, Rob] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, San Diego, CA 92093 USA",John Templeton Foundation [44000]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0935347]; Northwestern University; CIFARCanadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"KRA was supported as a CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar.

While studies have revealed significant progress in identifying risk factors for aspiration pneumonia, the clinical presentation and diagnosis remain challenging to healthcare providers. Areas covered: We conducted a broad literature review using the MeSH heading in PubMed/MEDLINE of ?aspiration pneumonia? from January 1970 to July 2019. The understanding of the microbiology of aspiration pneumonia has evolved from a possible shift in the causative organisms away from anaerobes to traditional community-acquired pneumonia organisms. The importance of this shift is not yet known, but it has questioned the pathogenic role of anaerobes, appropriate anaerobic testing and the role of these pathogens in the pulmonary microbiome in patients with pneumonia. The identification of risk factors led to strategies to prevent or minimize the risk of aspiration pneumonia with moderate success. Expert opinion: Our expert opinion is that further research is needed to determine the role of the microbiome with aspiration pneumonia and patient risk factors. There is also a great need to develop clinical tools to help providers diagnose, treat, and prevent aspiration pneumonia.","[Rodriguez, Abraham E.; Restrepo, Marcos, I] Univ Texas Hlth, Div Pulm Dis & Crit Care Med, San Antonio, TX USA; [Rodriguez, Abraham E.; Restrepo, Marcos, I] South Texas Vet Hlth Care Syst, Div Pulm Dis & Crit Care Med, San Antonio, TX USA",,,0,Oct-03,2019,12,10,10.1080/17512433.2019.1663730,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

While this approach has been valuable, emerging time series analyses on vertebrate gut microbiomes show that gut microbial composition can change rapidly from 1 day to the next, with consequences for host physical functioning, health, and fitness. Hence, the next frontier of microbiome research will require longitudinal perspectives. Here we argue that primatologists, with their traditional focus on tracking the lives of individual animals and familiarity with longitudinal fecal sampling, are well positioned to conduct research at the forefront of gut microbiome dynamics. We begin by reviewing some of the most important ecological processes governing microbiome change over time, and briefly summarizing statistical challenges and approaches to microbiome time series analysis. We then introduce five questions of general interest to microbiome science where we think field-based primate studies are especially well positioned to fill major gaps: (a) Do early life events shape gut microbiome composition in adulthood? (b) Do shifting social landscapes cause gut microbial change? (c) Are gut microbiome phenotypes heritable across variable environments? (d) Does the gut microbiome show signs of host aging? And (e) do gut microbiome composition and dynamics predict host health and fitness? For all of these questions, we highlight areas where primatologists are uniquely positioned to make substantial contributions. We review preliminary evidence, discuss possible study designs, and suggest future directions. Research Highlights To date nearly all insights into the processes shaping vertebrate gut microbiomes have emerged from studies that have cross-sectional designs, but emerging time series analyses show that gut microbiomes can change rapidly from 1 day to the next. Field-based primate studies, owing to their focus on the lives of individual animals, and the relative ease of collecting longitudinal fecal samples from known animals, are better positioned to collect these data than studies of humans or other species. We propose five questions of general interest to microbiome science where field-based primate studies are especially well positioned to fill major gaps. We review preliminary evidence, discuss possible study designs, and suggest future directions.","[Bjork, Johannes R.; Dasari, Mauna; Archie, Elizabeth A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Grieneisen, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN USA",,,0,OCT,2019,81,10-Nov,10.1002/ajp.22970,Zoology

Whereas feeding strategy reflects evolutionary adaptations to a host's environment, diet is a more proximate measure of food intake. Host phylogeny, which is intertwined with feeding strategy, is an additional, and often confounding factor that shapes GMBs across host lineages. Nocturnal strepsirrhines are an intriguing and underutilized group in which to examine the links between these three factors and GMB composition. Here, we compare GMB composition in four species of captive, nocturnal strepsirrhines with varying feeding strategies and phylogenetic relationships, but nearly identical diets. We use 16S rRNA sequences to determine gut bacterial composition. Despite similar husbandry conditions, including diet, we find that GMB composition varies significantly across host species and is linked to host feeding strategy and phylogeny. The GMBs of the omnivorous and the frugivorous species were significantly more diverse than were those of the insectivorous and exudativorous species. Across all hosts, GMBs were enriched for bacterial taxa associated with the macronutrient resources linked to the host's respective feeding strategy. Ultimately, the reported variation in microbiome composition suggests that the impacts of captivity and concurrent diet do not overshadow patterns of feeding strategy and phylogeny. As our understanding of primate GMBs progresses, populations of captive primates can provide insight into the evolution of host-microbe relationships, as well as inform future captive management protocols that enhance primate health and conservation.","[Bornbusch, Sally L.; Greene, Lydia K.] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, 127 Biol Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Greene, Lydia K.] Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [McKenney, Erin A.] North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Volkoff, Savannah J.; Gerhard, William A.; Gunsch, Claudia K.] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Midani, Firas S.; Granek, Joshua] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Joseph, Gail] North Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Energy & Environm Syst, Greensboro, NC USA; [Iloghalu, Uchenna] North Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Greensboro, NC USA",Division of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [DGE 1545220]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE 1545220]; Duke Microbiome Center,,1,OCT,2019,81,10-Nov,10.1002/ajp.22986,Zoology

Early life experiences that alter diet and social contact also influence these outcomes. Despite the growing number of studies in this area, no studies to date have examined the contribution of early life experiences on the gut microbiome in infants across development. Such studies are important for understanding the biological and environmental factors that contribute to optimal gut microbial colonization and subsequent health. We studied infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) across the first 6 months of life that were pseudo-randomly assigned to one of two different rearing conditions at birth: mother-peer-reared (MPR), in which infants were reared in social groups with many other adults and peers and nursed on their mothers, or nursery-reared (NR), in which infants were reared by human caregivers, fed formula, and given daily social contact with peers. We analyzed the microbiome from rectal swabs (total N=97; MPR=43, NR=54) taken on the day of birth and at postnatal Days 14, 30, 90, and 180 using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial composition differences were evident as early as 14 days, with MPR infants exhibiting a lower abundance of Bifidobacterium and a higher abundance of Bacteroides than NR infants. The most marked differences were observed at 90 days, when Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Prevotella differed across rearing groups. By Day 180, no differences in the relative abundances of the bacteria of interest were observed. These novel findings in developing primate neonates indicate that the early social environment as well as diet influence gut microbiota composition very early in life. These results also lay the groundwork for mechanistic studies examining the effects of early experiences on gut microbiota across development with the ultimate goal of understanding the clinical significance of developmental changes. Research Highlights The first prospective, longitudinal analysis of the primate gut microbiome in infant monkeys beginning at birth revealed early rearing effects in gut bacterial colonization as early as 14 days. By 90 days, marked differences in the relative abundances of many genera of bacteria were evident, including Clostridium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium.Early social environments as well as diet appear to influence gut bacterial colonization very early in life and persist through at least 6 months of age.","[Dettmer, Amanda M.] Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Lab Comparat Ethol, Poolesville, MD USA; [Dettmer, Amanda M.] Yale Sch Med, Yale Child Study Ctr, 230S Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Allen, Jacob M.; Jaggers, Robert M.; Bailey, Michael T.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Microbial Pathogenesis, Columbus, OH USA; [Bailey, Michael T.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [Z01 HD001106-25]; NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI); Legacy Award; Research Institute at the Nationwide Children's Hospital; American Society of Primatologists,,0,OCT,2019,81,10-Nov,10.1002/ajp.22969,Zoology

In the case of small-bodied primates, because of their limited gut volume, rapid food passage rate, and high metabolic rate, they are hypothesized to maintain high digestive efficiency by exploiting foods rich in protein, fats, and readily available energy. However, our understanding of the dietary requirements of wild primates is limited because little is known concerning the contributions of their gut microbiome to the breakdown and assimilation of macronutrients and energy. To study how the gut microbiome contributes to the feeding ecology of a small-bodied primate, we analyzed the fecal microbiome composition and metabolome of 22 wild saddleback tamarins (adult body mass 360-390g) in Northern Bolivia. Samples were analyzed using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V5 regions, coupled with GC-MS metabolomic profiling. Our analysis revealed that the distal microbiome of Leontocebus weddelli is largely dominated by two main bacterial genera: Xylanibacter and Hallella (34.714.7 and 22.612.4%, respectively). A predictive analysis of functions likely carried out by bacteria in the tamarin gut demonstrated the dominance of membrane transport systems and carbohydrate metabolism as the predominant metabolic pathways. Moreover, given a fecal metabolome composed mainly of glucose, fructose, and lactic acid (21.715.9%, 16.510.7%, and 6.8 +/- 5.5%, respectively), the processing of highly fermentable carbohydrates appears to play a central role in the nutritional ecology of these small-bodied primates. Finally, the results also show a potential influence of environmentally-derived bacteria in colonizing the tamarin gut. These results indicate high energetic turnover in the distal gut of Weddell's saddleback tamarin, likely influenced by dominant bacterial taxa that facilitate dietary dependence on highly digestible carbohydrates present in nectar, plant exudates, and ripe fruits. Research Highlights The tamarin gut microbiome appears to be devoted principally to the fermentation of simple sugars.

In social animals, distinct microbial communities characterize different social groups across a variety of taxa, although little longitudinal research has been conducted that demonstrates how this divergence occurs. Our study addresses this question by characterizing the gut microbial composition of an African Old World monkey, the black-and-white colobus (Colobus vellerosus), before and after a social group fission event. Gut microbial taxonomic composition of these monkeys was profiled using the V-4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and pairwise-relatedness values were calculated for all individuals using 17 short tandem repeat loci and partial pedigree information. The two social groups in this study were found to harbor distinct microbial signatures after the fission event from which they emerged, while these communities were not divergent in the same individuals before this event. Three genera were found to differ in abundance between the two new social groups: Parabacteroides, Coprococcus, and Porphyromonadaceae. Additionally, although this fission happened partially along lines of relatedness, relatedness did not structure the differences that we found. Taken together, this study suggests that distinct gut microbial profiles can emerge in social groups in <1 year and recommends further work into more finely mapping the timescales, causes, and potentially adaptive effects of this recurring trend toward distinct group microbial signatures.","[Goodfellow, Claire K.; Christie, Diana M.; Ting, Nelson] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Goodfellow, Claire K.; Whitney, Tabor] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Christie, Diana M.; Ting, Nelson] Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Sicotte, Pascale] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Wikberg, Eva C.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Anthropol, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P50GM098911, P50GM098911, P50 GM098911]; Wenner-Gren Foundation [8172]; American Society of Primatologists; University of Calgary; International Primatological Society; University of Oregon's O'Day Fellowship Program in Biological Sciences and Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation; University of Oregon; Alberta Ingenuity; META Center for Systems Biology; Sweden-America Foundation; Leakey Foundation; Province of Alberta",,0,OCT,2019,81,10-Nov,10.1002/ajp.22966,Zoology

Social group is repeatedly implicated as an important predictor of gut microbiome structure among primates, with individuals in neighboring social groups exhibiting distinct microbiomes. Here we examine whether group membership is a predictor of gut microbiome structure and diversity across three groups of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) inhabiting a seasonal Costa Rican forest. We collected 62 fecal samples from 18 adult females during four sampling bouts. Sampling bouts spanned the dry-to-wet-to-dry seasonal transitions. To investigate gut microbial composition, we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We used the DADA2 pipeline to assign amplicon sequence variants and the RDP database to classify taxa. Our findings are: 1) gut microbiomes of capuchins clustered by social group in the late dry season, but this pattern was less evident in other sampling bouts; 2) social group was a significant variable in a PERMANOVA test of beta diversity, but it accounted for less variation than season; 3) social group was not an important predictor of abundance for the ten most abundant microbial taxa in capuchins; 4) when examining log2-fold abundances of microbes between social groups, there were significant differences in some pairwise comparisons. While this is suggestive of group-wide differences, individual variation may have a strong impact and should be assessed in future studies. Overall, we found a minor impact of social group membership on the gut microbiota of wild white-faced capuchins. Future research including home range overlap and resource use, as well as fine-scale investigation of individual variation, will further elucidate patterns of socially structured microbes. Research Highlights Capuchin gut microbiomes clustered by social group in the late dry season, but less so in other seasons.

The use of microbial metabolites has become an attractive and more feasible preference because they are versatile, degradable and ecofriendly, unlike chemicals. In order to achieve this aim, it is then imperative to explore microbes that are very close to the root of a plant, especially where they are more concentrated and have efficient activities called the rhizosphere. Extensive varieties of bacteria, archaea, fungi and other microbes are found inhabiting the rhizosphere with various interactions with the plant host.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety associated with probiotic treatment for BV. Methods: We searched multiple databases covering up to 1 March 2018. Studies published as blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing treatment using probiotic versus active or placebo control in BV patients were included, with at least one-month follow-up. Random effects model and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were applied. Results: Ten studies (n = 2321) were included. Compared with placebo, the probiotics-only therapy resulted in a beneficial outcome both in clinical cure rate at the 30th day (risk ratio, RR = 2.57; 95% confidential interval, 95% CI: 1.96 to 3.37), and Nugent score (mean difference, MD = -2.71; 95% CI: -3.41 to -2.00). This effect decreased but remained significant after eight weeks. Probiotics-post-antibiotics therapy had a decreased effect only for a short term and possibly among studies with a mostly black study population. No extra adverse events were observed. The TSA suggested a larger sample size for effective evaluation of the probiotics as a supplementary remedy. Conclusions: Probiotic regimes are safe and may exhibit a short-term and long-term beneficial effect for BV treatment. The ethnic-specific result for the probiotic used after antibiotics is worthy of further study.","[Wang, Ziyue; He, Yining; Zheng, Yingjie] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ziyue] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ziyue] Peking Univ, China Ctr Hlth Dev Studies, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [He, Yining; Zheng, Yingjie] Fudan Univ, Natl Hlth Commiss, Key Lab Hlth Technol Assessment, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [He, Yining; Zheng, Yingjie] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Minist Educ, Key Lab Publ Hlth Safety, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",CURE (Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment) [16901]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81373065],"This meta-analysis was funded by CURE (Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment) (No. 16901), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81373065).",0,OCT,2019,16,20,10.3390/ijerph16203859,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In humans, aging is associated with lowered overall functioning and increased mortality out of the risk for various age-related diseases. Hence, researchers are pushed to find effective natural interventions that can promote healthy aging and extend lifespan. Royal jelly (RJ) is a natural product that is fed to bee queens throughout their entire life. Thanks to RJ, bee queens enjoy an excellent reproductive function and lengthened lifespan compared with bee workers, despite the fact that they have the same genome. This review aimed to investigate the effect of RJ and/or its components on lifespan/healthspan in various species by evaluating the most relevant studies. Moreover, we briefly discussed the positive effects of RJ on health maintenance and age-related disorders in humans. Whenever possible, we explored the metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms through which RJ can modulate age-related mechanisms to extend lifespan. RJ and its ingredients-proteins and their derivatives e.g., royalactin; lipids e.g., 10-hydroxydecenoic acid; and vitamins e.g., pantothenic acid-improved healthspan and extended lifespan in worker honeybees Apis mellifera, Drosophila Melanogaster flies, Gryllus bimaculatus crickets, silkworms, Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, and mice. The longevity effect was attained via various mechanisms: downregulation of insulin-like growth factors and targeting of rapamycin, upregulation of the epidermal growth factor signaling, dietary restriction, and enhancement of antioxidative capacity. RJ and its protein and lipid ingredients have the potential to extend lifespan in various creatures and prevent senescence of human tissues in cell cultures. These findings pave the way to inventing specific RJ anti-aging drugs.

The brain-gut-microbiota axis has been described as a new paradigm for advancing understanding and treatment of the disorder. There is now over-whelming evidence to support the fact that gut microbes have a major impact on central neurochemistry and behaviour, especially stress related disorders such as depression. Recent studies indicate that patients with depression have a gut dysbiosis. The reason for this dysbiosis is uncertain. Over recent decades, dietary patterns in Europe and elsewhere have undergone major compositional changes, with increased intakes of red meat, high fat foods, and refined sugars. Individuals who consume a Mediterranean diet have lower rates of depression and a recent study suggests that a Mediterranean diet may have antidepressant properties. Assuming this to be the case, which components of the Mediterranean diet mediate the effects? Highly levels of polyphenols or polyunsaturated fatty acids are obvious candidates.

Furthermore, recent research in the field of brain imaging focused on the study of the relationship between gut microbial ecology and large-scale brain networks, which will help to decipher the influence of the microbiome on brain function and potentially will serve to identify multiple mediators of the gut-brain axis. Thus, knowledge about optimal nutrition by modulating gut microbiota-brain axis activity will allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the developing brain during critical windows. In addition, this knowledge will open new avenues for developing novel microbiota-modulating based diet interventions during pregnancy and early life to prevent metabolic disorders, as well as neurodevelopmental deficits and brain functional disorders.","[Cerdo, Tomas; Dieguez, Estefania; Campoy, Cristina] Univ Granada, Sch Med, Dept Paediat, Avda Invest 11, Granada 18016, Spain; [Cerdo, Tomas; Dieguez, Estefania; Campoy, Cristina] Univ Granada, EURISTIKOS Excellence Ctr Paediat Res Biomed Res, Granada, Spain; [Cerdo, Tomas; Campoy, Cristina] Hlth Sci Technol Pk, BioHlth Res Inst Ibs Granada, Granada, Spain; [Cerdo, Tomas; Campoy, Cristina] Univ Granada, Biomed Res Ctr, Neurosci Inst, Granada, Spain; [Campoy, Cristina] Carlos III Hlth Inst Hlth Carlos III, Spanish Network Biomed Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Madrid, Spain; [Campoy, Cristina] Univ Granada, Brain Behav & Hlth Excellence Res Unit SC2, Granada, Spain","European Union 7th FP KBBE.2013.2.2-02-MyNewGut Project (""Factors influencing the human gut microbiome and its effect on the development of diet-related diseases and brain development"")European Union (EU) [613979]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness-GD-Brain Project [SAF2015-69265-c2.2]","Supported by funds from European Union 7th FP KBBE.2013.2.2-02-MyNewGut Project (""Factors influencing the human gut microbiome and its effect on the development of diet-related diseases and brain development,"" Grant Agreement 613979) and from Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness-GD-Brain Project (SAF2015-69265-c2.2).",0,OCT,2019,317,4,10.1152/ajpendo.00188.2019,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Physiology

Individual differences in response to stress have been linked to genetic and environmental factors and more recently, a role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of stress-related changes has been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence each other are poorly understood, and there are currently no established robust biomarkers of stress susceptibility. To determine the metabolic and microbial signatures underpinning physiological stress responses, we compared stress-sensitive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats to the normo-anxious Sprague Dawley (SD) strain. Here we report that acute stress-induced strain-specific changes in brain lipid metabolites were a prominent feature in WKY rats. The relative abundance of Lactococcus correlated with the relative proportions of many brain lipids. In contrast, plasma lipids were significantly elevated in response to stress in SD rats, but not in WKY rats. Supporting these findings, we found that the greatest difference between the SD and WKY microbiomes were the predicted relative abundance of microbial genes involved in lipid and energy metabolism. Our results provide potential insights for developing novel biomarkers of stress vulnerability, some of which appear genotype specific.","[Bassett, Shalome A.; Young, Wayne; Fraser, Karl; Dalziel, Julie E.; Ryan, Leigh; Roy, Nicole C.] AgResearch Ltd, Food Nutr & Hlth, Grasslands Res Ctr, Tennent Dr, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Bassett, Shalome A.; Young, Wayne; Fraser, Karl; Dalziel, Julie E.; Roy, Nicole C.] Massey Univ, Riddet Inst, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Young, Wayne; Fraser, Karl; Roy, Nicole C.] High Value Nutr Natl Sci Challenge, Auckland, New Zealand; [Webster, Jim] AgResearch Ltd, Farm Syst North, Ruakura Res Ctr, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Fitzgerald, Patrick; Dinan, Timothy G.; Cryan, John F.; Clarke, Gerard; Hyland, Niall] Univ Coll Cork, Lab Neurogastroenterol, APC Microbiome Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland; [Stanton, Catherine; Dinan, Timothy G.; Clarke, Gerard] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Stanton, Catherine] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Moorepk, Fermoy, Cork, Ireland; [Hyland, Niall] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Physiol, Cork, Ireland",New Zealand Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment through the AgResearch Strategic Science Investment Fund [A21246],"We thank Catherine Cameron for assistance with statistical analysis of the behavioural studies, Linda Samuelsson for assistance with SCFA data, and Stacey Burton, Kelly Dunstan and Suzanne Dowling for technical assistance.

Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are functionally associated with the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, there is no information on the frequency of MAIT cells in schizophrenia. Hence, we investigated changes in proportions of T cells, B cells and MAIT cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia in comparison to healthy controls. In line with earlier reports, we noted perturbations in T(h)17 cells. This study for the first time reports changes in frequencies of MAIT cells in a homogenous population of antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia.

However, given the promise and early stage of this treatment approach, there are also a number of ethical, social and regulatory issues associated with innovative probiotic therapy. In this article, a brief update is given on contemporary theories of the aetiology and management of the two commonest dental diseases, and on the roles of pre- and probiotics and oral biome transplant in the management of these diseases. The focus is primarily on four core issues: informed consent, risk-benefit assessment, how to determine suitable healthy donors, and commercialization and regulation. We discuss the safety and benefits of oral probiotics, not only concerning the products and quality control during their manufacture, but also regarding the depth of public knowledge about this topic. We point out that the requirement of listing ingredients honestly might be insufficient, and that the prevalent rhetoric of 'natural' and 'organic' as well as some health claims in the translational, innovative probiotic industry and markets are themselves misleading and should be carefully scrutinized.

A series of recent studies have shown that the microbiome influences the central nervous system in various ways, and consequently acts on the psychological well-being of the individual by mediating, among others, the reactions of stress and anxiety. From a specifically neuroethical point of view, according to some scholars, the particular composition of the microbiome-qua microbial community-can have consequences on the traditional idea of human individuality. Another neuroethical aspect concerns the reception of this new knowledge in relation to clinical applications. In fact, attention to the balance of the microbiome-which includes eating behavior, the use of psychobiotics and, in the treatment of certain diseases, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation-may be limited or even prevented by a biased negative attitude. This attitude derives from a prejudice related to everything that has to do with the organic processing of food and, in general, with the human stomach and intestine: the latter have traditionally been regarded as low, dirty, contaminated and opposed to what belongs to the mind and the brain. This biased attitude can lead one to fail to adequately consider the new anthropological conceptions related to the microbiome, resulting in a state of health, both physical and psychological, inferior to what one might have by paying the right attention to the knowledge available today. Shifting from the ubiquitous high-low metaphor (which is synonymous with superior-inferior) to an inside-outside metaphor can thus be a neuroethical strategy to achieve a new and unbiased reception of the discoveries related to the microbiome.","[Lavazza, Andrea] Ctr Univ Int, Neuroeth, Arezzo, Italy; [Sironi, Vittorio A.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Inst Hist Biomed Thought, Milan, Italy",,,0,OCT,2019,28,4,10.1017/S0963180119000653,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Social Sciences, Biomedical"

According to this scenario, nervous systems are a consequence of two preceding animal innovations, external digestion and motility, which have co-evolved in concert with nervous systems ever since.

In recent years, the diversity of the gut microbiota has emerged to play a significant role in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other mood and anxiety disorders. Importantly, the role of the gut microbiota in the treatment of such disorders remains to be elucidated. Here, we provide a review of the literature regarding the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut microbiota and the implications this might have on their efficacy in the treatment of mood disorders. Methods: First, an estimation of gut serotonin reuptake inhibitor concentrations was computed based on pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal transit properties of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Literature regarding the in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial properties of serotonin reuptake inhibitors was gathered, and the estimated gut concentrations were examined in the context of these data. Computer-based investigation revealed putative mechanisms for the antimicrobial effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Results: In vivo evidence using animal models shows an antimicrobial effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut microbiota. Examination of the estimated physiological concentrations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the gastrointestinal tract collected from in vitro studies suggests that the microbial community of both the small intestine and the colon are exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors for at least 4 hours per day at concentrations that are likely to exert an antimicrobial effect. The potential mechanisms of the effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut microbiota were postulated to include inhibition of efflux pumps and/or amino acid transporters. Conclusion: This review raises important issues regarding the role that gut microbiota play in the treatment of mood-related behaviours, which holds substantial potential clinical outcomes for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and other mood-related disorders.","[McGovern, Abigail S.; Hamlin, Adam S.; Winter, Gal] Univ New England, Sch Sci & Technol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",,,0,DEC,2019,53,12,10.1177/0004867419877954,Psychiatry

Soil processes in urban systems are influenced by the microbiome, specifically bacterial and fungal communities that are currently recognized as the primary drivers of soil organic matter dynamics. However, our understanding of biotic controls on microbial communities is incomplete, particularly in regard to the roles of invertebrates. We aim to highlight how invertebrates and their interactions with microbial communities may shape ecosystem processes in urban systems. We discuss three primary pathways through which invertebrates are known to influence the soil microbiome: dispersal of microorganisms throughout soils, grazing on microbial biomass, and mixing of organic inputs within soils and subsequently altering microbial resource accessibility. These invertebrate-mediated pathways may be particularly important because of their influence on soil microbiomes of urban systems. We also propose future research directions aimed at quantifying the influence of invertebrates on soil microbial processes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of urban microbiome function. Understanding the impact of invertebrates on the microbiome of urban systems can potentially lead to better management of microbiomes and enhance microbe-driven ecosystem services.","[Bray, Natalie; Wickings, Kyle] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Cornell Agritech, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at Cornell University,NB and KW were supported by funding from the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at Cornell University.,0,Sep-25,2019,7,,10.3389/fevo.2019.00359,Ecology

It is imperative that those working with people with mental illness are aware of the rationale and current evidence base for such treatment strategies. In this review, we provide an overview of the gut microbiome, what it is, and what it does in relation to gut-brain communication and psychological function. We describe the fundamental principles and basic techniques used in microbiome-gut-brain axis research in an accessible way for a clinician audience. We summarize the current evidence in relation to microbiome-based strategies for various psychiatric disorders and provide some practical advice that can be given to patients seeking to try a probiotic for mental health benefit.","[Butler, Mary, I; Moerkl, Sabrina; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat, Cork, Ireland; [Butler, Mary, I; Moerkl, Sabrina; Sandhu, Kiran, V; Cryan, John F.; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Moerkl, Sabrina] Med Univ Graz, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapeut Med, Graz, Austria; [Sandhu, Kiran, V; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland",,,1,NOV,2019,64,11,10.1177/0706743719874168,Psychiatry

Several clinical trials examining the effects of intranasal oxytocin for improving social and behavioral function in ASD have had mixed or inclusive outcomes. The heterogeneity in clinical trials outcomes may reflect large interindividual expression variations of the oxytocin and/or vasopressin receptor genes OXTR and AVPR1A, respectively. To explore this hypothesis we examined the expression of both genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ASD children, their non-ASD siblings, and age-matched neurotypical children aged 3 to 16 years of age as well as datamined published ASD datasets. Both genes were found to have large inter-individual variations. Higher OXTR and AVPR1A expression was associated with lower Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores. OXTR expression was associated with less severe behavior and higher adaptive behavior on additional standardized measures. Combining the sum expression levels OXTR, AVPR1A, and IGF1 yielded the strongest correlation with ABC scores. We propose that future clinical trials in ASD children with oxytocin, oxytocin mimetics and additional tentative therapeutics should assess the prognostic value of their PBMC mRNA expression of OXTR, AVPR1A, and IGF1.","[Voinsky, Irene; Svigals, Julie; Gurwitz, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Human Mol Genet & Biochem, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Bennuri, Sirish C.; Rose, Shannon] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Bennuri, Sirish C.; Rose, Shannon] Arkansas Childrens Res Inst, Little Rock, AR 72202 USA; [Frye, Richard E.] Univ Arizona, Coll Med Phoenix, Dept Child Hlth, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Frye, Richard E.] Phoenix Childrens Hosp, Barrow Neurol Inst, Phoenix, AZ 85016 USA; [Gurwitz, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel",,,0,Sep-17,2019,9,,10.1038/s41598-019-49617-9,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Indigenous people in the region (Melanesians, Polynesians, Micronesians, Papuans, and Indigenous Australians) are over-represented on national, regional, and global scales for the burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases. Although social and environmental factors such as poverty, education, and access to health-care are assumed to be major drivers of this disease burden, there is also developing evidence that genetic and microbiotic factors should also be considered. To date, studies investigating genetic and/or microbiotic links with vulnerabilities to infectious and non-communicable diseases have mostly focused on populations in Europe, Asia, and USA, with uncertain associations for other populations such as indigenous communities in Oceania. Recent developments in personalized medicine have shown that identifying ethnicity-linked genetic vulnerabilities can be important for medical management. Although our understanding of the impacts of the gut microbiome on health is still in the early stages, it is likely that equivalent vulnerabilities will also be identified through the interaction between gut microbiome composition and function with pathogens and the host immune system. As rapid economic, dietary, and cultural changes occur throughout Oceania it becomes increasingly important that further research is conducted within indigenous populations to address the double burden of high rates of infectious diseases and rapidly rising non-communicable diseases so that comprehensive development goals can be planned.

However, novel therapeutic approaches are currently discussed, from augmentation strategies to novel treatments targeting the immune system or the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Therefore, we examined the potential beneficial effects of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic with pleiotropic, immunomodulatory action, alone or as augmentation of escitalopram on behavior, prefrontal microglial density, and the gut microbiome in rats selectively bred for high anxiety-like behavior (HAB). We show that concomitant with their high innate anxiety and depression, HABs have lower microglial numbers in the infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex and an altered gut microbiota composition compared with controls. Three weeks of minocycline treatment alleviated the depressive-like phenotype, further reduced microglial density, exclusively in male HAB rats, and reduced plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, coadministration of escitalopram, which had no effect alone, prevented these minocycline-induced effects. Moreover, minocycline led to a robust shift in cecal microbial composition in both HABs and rats nonselected for anxiety-like behavior. Minocycline markedly increased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiales Family XIII, families known for their butyrate production, with a corresponding increase and positive correlation in plasma 3-OH-butyrate levels in a trait-dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that the antidepressant effect of minocycline is sex- and trait-dependent, associated with a reduced microglial number in the prefrontal cortex, and with changes in microbial composition and their metabolites. These results further support the microbiomegut-brain axis as potential target in the treatment of depression.","[Schmidtner, Anna K.; Slattery, David A.; Gryksa, Katharina; Neumann, Inga D.] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg Ctr Neurosci, Dept Behav & Mol Neurobiol, Regensburg, Germany; [Slattery, David A.] Goethe Univ, Univ Hosp Frankfurt, Dept Psychiat Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Frankfurt, Germany; [Glaesner, Joachim; Hiergeist, Andreas; Gessner, Andre] Univ Hosp Regensburg, Inst Clin Microbiol & Hyg, Regensburg, Germany; [Malik, Victoria A.; Baghai, Thomas C.; Rupprecht, Rainer; Di Benedetto, Barbara] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg Ctr Neurosci, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Regensburg, Germany; [Hellmann-Regen, Julian; Heuser, Isabella] Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat, Sect Neurobiol, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01EE1401A, 01EE1401B]","We thank Lundbeck A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark) for generously providing Escitalopram oxalate.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed existing human interventional studies on putative effects of a plant-based diet on the metabolism and cognition, and what is known about the underlying mechanisms. Using the search terms ""plant-based OR vegan OR vegetarian AND diet AND intervention"" in PubMed filtered for clinical trials in humans retrieved 205 studies out of which 27, plus an additional search extending the selection to another five studies, were eligible for inclusion based on three independent ratings. We found robust evidence for short- to moderate-term beneficial effects of plant-based diets versus conventional diets (duration <= 24 months) on weight status, energy metabolism and systemic inflammation in healthy participants, obese and type-2 diabetes patients. Initial experimental studies proposed novel microbiome-related pathways, by which plant-based diets modulate the gut microbiome towards a favorable diversity of bacteria species, yet a functional ""bottom up"" signaling of plant-based diet-induced microbial changes remains highly speculative. In addition, little is known, based on interventional studies about cognitive effects linked to plant-based diets. Thus, a causal impact of plant-based diets on cognitive functions, mental and neurological health and respective underlying mechanisms has yet to be demonstrated. In sum, the increasing interest for plant-based diets raises the opportunity for developing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity, eating disorders and related comorbidities. Still, putative effects of plant-based diets on brain health and cognitive functions as well as the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored and new studies need to address these questions.","[Medawar, Evelyn; Villringer, Arno; Witte, A.

The adaptive function of such developmental plasticity, however, remains relatively untested in long-lived animals, resulting in much debate over which evolutionary models are most applicable. Furthermore, despite the promise of clinical interventions that might alleviate the health consequences of early-life adversity, research on the proximate mechanisms governing phenotypic responses to adversity have been largely limited to studies on glucocorticoids. Here, we synthesize the current state of research on developmental plasticity, discussing both ultimate and proximate mechanisms. First, we evaluate the utility of adaptive models proposed to explain developmental responses to early-life adversity, particularly for long-lived mammals such as humans. In doing so, we highlight how parent-offspring conflict complicates our understanding of whether mothers or offspring benefit from these responses. Second, we discuss the role of glucocorticoids and a second physiological system-the gut microbiome-that has emerged as an additional, clinically relevant mechanism by which early-life adversity can influence development. Finally, we suggest ways in which nonhuman primates can serve as models to study the effects of early-life adversity, both from evolutionary and clinical perspectives.","[Lu, Amy; Schneider-Crease, India] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, S-529 Circle Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Petrullo, Lauren; Feder, Jacob] SUNY Stony Brook, Lnterdept Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Carrera, Sofia] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Schneider-Crease, India; Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Ctr Studies Demog & Ecol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Leakey Foundation; National Institute on AgingUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [NIA-R00AG051764]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1723228, BCS-1723237, SBE-1714730]","Leakey Foundation; National Institute on Aging, Grant/Award Number: NIA-R00AG051764; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: BCS-1723228, BCS-1723237, SBE-1714730",0,SEP,2019,28,5,10.1002/evan.21791,Anthropology

Emerging evidence suggests a complex relationship between PTS, the brain-gut axis, the gut microbiome, and immune function. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be susceptible to PTS and its subsequent impacts. To date, no study has evaluated PTS in IBD in the United States. Methods: Adult patients with IBD were recruited from an outpatient gastroenterology practice, via social media, and via a research recruitment website. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were recruited as a comparison group. Participants completed demographic and disease information, surgical and hospitalization history, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Statistical analyses evaluated rates of PTS in IBD and IBS, including differences between groups for PTS severity. Regression analyses determined potential predictors of PTS. Results: One hundred eighty-eight participants (131 IBD, 57 IBS) completed the study. Thirty-two percent of IBD and 26% of IBS patients met the criteria for significant PTS symptoms based on PCL-C cutoffs. Inflammatory bowel disease patients are more likely to attribute PTS to their disease than IBS patients. Crohn's disease (CD) patients appear to be the most likely to experience PTS, including those being hospitalized or undergoing ileostomy surgery. Symptom severity is the greatest predictor of PTS for ulcerative colitis and IBS. Conclusions: Although PTS is relevant in both IBS and IBD, IBD patients are seemingly more susceptible to PTS due their disease experiences, especially CD patients. The nature of PTS symptoms may contribute to IBD disease processes, most notably through sleep disturbance and ANS arousal. Clinicians should assess for PTS in IBD patients as standard of care, especially after a hospitalization or surgery.","[Taft, Tiffany H.; Bedell, Alyse; Craven, Meredith R.; Guadagnoli, Livia; Quinton, Sarah; Hanauer, Stephen B.] Northwestern Univ, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [NIH-NIDDK: 3T32DK101363-05S1]; NIH-NIDDKUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [1P01DK117824-01],Supported by: L.G. and M.C. are supported by National Institutes of HealthNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK: 3T32DK101363-05S1).

Standardisation in image acquisition and advances in computational approaches has made it possible to study large data sets of imaging studies, identify network properties and integrate them with non-imaging data.

The etiology of ASD likely involves interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies suggest that oral and gut microbiome play important roles in the pathogenesis of inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disruption of the gut-brain axis, which may contribute to ASD pathophysiology. The majority of previous studies used unrelated neurotypical individuals as controls, and they focused on the gut microbiome, with little attention paid to the oral flora. In this pilot study, we used a first degree-relative matched design combined with high fidelity 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene amplicon sequencing in order to characterize the oral and gut microbiotas of patients with ASD compared to neurotypical individuals, and explored the utility of microbiome markers for ASD diagnosis and subtyping of clinical comorbid conditions. Additionally, we aimed to develop microbiome biomarkers to monitor responses to a subsequent clinical trial using probiotics supplementation. We identified distinct features of gut and salivary microbiota that differed between ASD patients and neurotypical controls. We next explored the utility of some differentially enriched markers for ASD diagnosis and examined the association between the oral and gut microbiomes using network analysis. Due to the tremendous clinical heterogeneity of the ASD population, we explored the relationship between microbiome and clinical indices as an attempt to extract microbiome signatures assocociated with clinical subtypes, including allergies, abdominal pain, and abnormal dietary habits. The diagnosis of ASD currently relies on psychological testing with potentially high subjectivity. Given the emerging role that the oral and gut microbiome plays in systemic diseases, our study will provide preliminary evidence for developing microbial markers that can be used to diagnose or guide treatment of ASD and comorbid conditions. These preliminary results also serve as a starting point to test whether altering the oral and gut microbiome could improve co-morbid conditions in patients with ASD and further modify the core symptoms of ASD.","[Kong, Xuejun; Liu, Jun; Koh, Madelyn; Hobbie, Clara; Liu, Kevi] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, 149 13th St Charlestown, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Kong, Xuejun; Liu, Jun] Harvard Med Sch, 25 Shattuck St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cetinbas, Murat; Sadreyev, Ruslan] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Huang, Hui; Adeseye, Adetaye; He, Puhan] Harvard Sch Dent Med, 188 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhu, Junli] Fisher Coll, 1 Arlington St, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Russell, Hugh] Precidiag Inc, 27 Strathmore Rd, Natick, MA 01760 USA; [Onderdonk, Andrew B.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Massachusetts General Hospital at the Athinoula A.

With advanced technology, survival is good, but long-term developmental outcomes are very poor for these especially vulnerable newborns. The poor outcomes are similar to those described for adversity in childhood, ascribed to toxic stress. Toxic stress is defined as the absence of the buffering protection of adult support. Parental absence has been strictly enforced in neonatal care units for many reasons and could lead to toxic stress. The understanding of toxic stress comes from discoveries about our genome and epigenetics, the microbiome, developmental neuroscience and the brain connectome, and life history theory. The common factor is the early environment that gives (a) signals to epigenes, (b) sensory inputs to neural circuits, and (c) experiences for reproductive fitness. For human newborns that environment is direct skin-to-skin contact from birth. Highly conserved neuroendocrine behaviors determined by environment are described in this review. The scientific rationale underlying skin-to-skin contact is presented: autonomic development and regulation of the physiology leads to emotional connection and achieving resilience. Maternal-neonate separation prevents these critical neural processes from taking place, but also channel development into an alternative developmental strategy.

The microbiome composition differs between individuals, partly due to the polymorphic immune system, as well as the environment, making the microbe-host interplay unique in each one of us. Ageing is a gradual loss of function in part due to reduced repair mechanisms and accumulation of tissue damage through mechanisms largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that our indigenous microbes, a known major regulator of human physiology, are also connected to regulate the ageing process through signalling pathways and metabolites though the biological mechanisms are unknown. At an ageing meeting in Singapore in 2018, investigators discussed the current understanding of microbe regulation and its impact on healthy ageing. This review summarizes the highlights from the meeting and conveys some of the new ideas that emerged around gut microbes and the biology of ageing. While highly speculative, an idea emerged in which gut microbes constantly respond and evolve to environmental cues, as part of an ageing process, thus serving as a second messenger to support and attenuate organ decline in a diet-, gender- and age-dependent manner.","[Reza, Musarrat Maisha; Pettersson, Sven] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc NVS, Stockholm, Sweden; [Reza, Musarrat Maisha] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Finlay, B.

This cross-country longitudinal cohort of 2310 deeply phenotyped subjects with various forms of dementia and mild memory loss or concerns, along with cognitively intact elderly subjects, will test hypotheses generated by these teams. Methods: The COMPASS-ND protocol, initial grant proposal for funding, fifth semi-annual CCNA Progress Report submitted to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research December 2017, and other documents supplemented by modifications made and lessons learned after implementation were used by the authors to create the description of the study provided here. Results: The CCNA COMPASS-ND cohort includes participants from across Canada with various cognitive conditions associated with or at risk of neurodegenerative diseases. They will undergo a wide range of experimental, clinical, imaging, and genetic investigation to specifically address the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these conditions in the aging population. Data derived from clinical and cognitive assessments, biospecimens, brain imaging, genetics, and brain donations will be used to test hypotheses generated by CCNA research teams and other Canadian researchers. The study is the most comprehensive and ambitious Canadian study of dementia. Initial data posting occurred in 2018, with the full cohort to be accrued by 2020. Conclusion: Availability of data from the COMPASS-ND study will provide a major stimulus for dementia research in Canada in the coming years.","[Chertkow, Howard] McGill Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chertkow, Howard; Whitehead, Victor; Pilon, Randi] Lady Davis Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Black, Sandra E.; Masellis, Mario] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Black, Sandra E.; Masellis, Mario; Tierney, Mary C.] Sunnybrook Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Borrie, Michael] Western Univ, Dept Geriatr Med, London, ON, Canada; [Borrie, Michael; Fogarty, Jennifer; Lindsay, Joseph; Best, Sarah] Lawson Hlth Res Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Feldman, Howard H.; Hsiung, Ging-Yuek R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Feldman, Howard H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Gauthier, Serge; Poirier, Judes] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hogan, David B.] Univ Calgary, Dept Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Hogan, David B.; Smith, Eric E.] Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Calgary, AB, Canada; [McGilton, Katherine] Univ Toronto, Lawrence S Bloomberg Fac Nursing, Toronto, ON, Canada; [McGilton, Katherine] Toronto Rehabil Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rockwood, Kenneth; Andrew, Melissa] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Med, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Rylett, R.

Not only does aDNA encrypt genetic data from a particular individual, it also carries information about the microbial communities that were present in the individual. However, the process of such data mining has many intrinsic challenges. One of the main challenges in aDNA research is the contamination of archaeological material with environmental bacteria from the surrounding soil and postmortem microbial sources. The goal of this study was to identify the microbial communities in human archaeological bone samples dated 15th - 17th century AD and to compare the microbiome patterns with the corresponding soil samples of the burial environment. Samples were analysed by 16S rRNA-based profiling of bacterial communities using Ion Torrent technology. The results showed that the most represented phyla in the bone samples were Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Bacteroidetes. All identified microbial taxa of the bone samples coincided with the corresponding soil samples, indicating significant infiltration and contamination of archaeological remains with microbial species of the burial environment. However, differences in microbial community composition between the bone and soil samples were observed at both the phylum and genus levels, as indicated by statistically significant beta-diversity analysis results. A deeper investigation of the Firmicutes phylum showed significant differences between the bone and soil samples by alpha- and beta-diversity analyses. Several genera belonging to Firmicutes were significantly more abundant in the soil samples than in the bone samples and vice versa. In conclusion, the analysis of the microbiome profiles of archaeological bone and corresponding soil samples revealed significant diversity in microbial compositions. It appeared that some bacteria may infiltrate the bone matter through the process of tissue decomposition and remain trapped inside for a longer period of time. Archaeological human bone samples might provide significant data on the investigation of ancient human microbiomes; however, environmental bacteria from the surrounding soil must be considered an important contamination factor.","[Kazarina, Alisa; Kimsis, Janis; Pole, Ilva; Zole, Egija; Leonova, Viktorija; Ranka, Renate] Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, Ratsupites Str 1, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia; [Gerhards, Guntis; Peterson-Gordina, Elina] Univ Latvia, Inst Latvian Hist, Riga, Latvia",ERDFEuropean Union (EU) [1.1.1.1/16/A/101],This work was supported by the ERDF grant Nr. 1.1.1.1/16/A/101.,0,SEP,2019,109,,10.1016/j.jas.2019.104989,"Anthropology; Archaeology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"

Objectives The aim of the study was to present a replicable pathway model of recruitment via retrospective chart review and describe outcomes of the recruitment methods used in the model on enrollment, scheduling, and attrition. Methods This retrospective chart review included recruitment data from participants of a parent grant (n = 99) that met chart review inclusion criteria (n = 47) for a follow-up study measuring microbiome data of preterm infants at toddler and preschool age. Results Over a 3-year recruitment period, 25 of the 47 participants eligible for recruitment were enrolled in the follow-up study. Initial contact was more likely to be performed via mail and e-mail for first time points and via phone for subsequent contact and second time points. For scheduling, phone contact was the method utilized most frequently for both groups, with online scheduling second when introduced in the preschool group. Two participants were lost to follow-up, resulting in an attrition rate of 8%. Discussion This recruitment pathway model offers researchers multiple recruitment methods for initial contact and scheduling that may be useful in contacting more participants to positively affect enrollment and reduce attrition rates for longitudinal cohorts.

Recent Findings Changes in the gut microbiome increase the release of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which activate a gut inflammatory response. Gut pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate the afferent vagal nerve which in turn impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis inducing symptoms associated with depression. Recent research suggests that gut inflammation can induce neuroinflammation which, in turn, stimulates microglia activation and the kynurenine pathway and can activate systemic inflammation-inducing depressive symptoms. Promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, limiting exposure to pesticides, limiting medications that affect the microbiome and the use of such things pre/probiotics and other interventions may complement existing efforts to curb the rise in depression.

Co-morbid depressive symptoms predict a poor IBD course, including increased risk of relapse and surgery, which is inconsistently improved by psychological treatments. Rather than being distinct systems, there is compelling evidence for bidirectional communication between gut and brain, driven by neural, metabolic, endocrine and inflammatory mediators. An emerging concept is that depressive symptoms may be mechanistically linked to excess inflammation and dysregulation of the gut-brain axis. Given the close link between the intestinal microbiota and host immune responses, patients prone to shifts in their intestinal microbiome, including smokers, those with poor diet and early life stress, may be exposed to exaggerated immune responses. Excess inflammation is associated with brain changes (depressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep difficulties) and worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, which are exacerbated by psychological distress. Equally, treatments both for depressive symptoms and IBD provide opportunities to break this cycle by reducing the causes and effects of inflammation. As well as addressing potential risk factors such as smoking and diet, treatments to alter the microbiome may reduce depressive symptoms. Observational evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory treatments for IBD may improve co-morbid depressive symptoms correlating with reduction in inflammation. With a growing range of treatments targeting inflammation centrally, peripherally and in the gut, IBD provides a unique model to understand the interplay between brain and gut in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms, both in IBD and in the whole population.","[Moulton, C.

Concerns are growing that missing microbes might be behind the current rise in inflammatory disease. Microbial absence and dysbiosis have been linked to a range of hygiene practices, fuelling popular anxiety and confusion about being both too clean and the risk of superbugs. A growing number of microbiology projects allow some publics to engage with DNA sequencing, and enable DIY experiments in microbiome management. Advocates promote this as the democratisation of sequencing. This paper outlines a new methodology for making the microbiome public, and explores the potential of thinking with microbes for social science research. It reports on an interdisciplinary research project, in which a small number of households in Oxford designed and conducted repeated experiments on their kitchen microbiome. These experiments explored the composition of the microbiome and the effects of different hygiene practices. The analysis identifies two challenges of public microbiome research: the mismatch between a vernacular species ontology and the ecological understanding of the microbiome, and the difficulties posed by scientific uncertainty. The reported methodology was able to engage publics in the design and interpretation of experiments, and to work with the surprises generated by open research. Thinking with microbes as ecologies revealed the tensions between an antibiotic and a probiotic approach to domestic hygiene. Public microbiome research needs new metaphors and visualisation tools, and an awareness of the political economic and epistemic barriers that will configure the promised democratisation of sequencing. The conclusion calls for further interdisciplinary and participatory microbiome research to guide the emergence of this new technology.","[Lorimer, Jamie; Hodgetts, Timothy; Grenyer, Richard; Greenhough, Beth; McLeod, Carmen; Dwyer, Andrew] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/N006968/1],"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/N006968/1",1,SEP,2019,44,3,10.1111/tran.12289,Geography

In particular, the age-related diet modifications can alter the gut microbiota biodiversity and determine the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa, resulting in microbiota dysbiosis with negative consequences for the host physiology. Unhealthy microbiota may then induce an acceleration of the age-related physiological changes, consequently concurring at determining the characteristic complexity of frail older persons. One of the major clinical manifestations of frailty is represented by the individual's physical decline. Besides of a well-established clinical phenotype of frailty, the qualitative and quantitative skeletal muscle impairment (i.e., sarcopenia) is today of particular interest for potentially serving as target for (pharmacological and nonpharmacological) interventions to prevent incident disability. Evidence suggests that gut microbiota is able to influence the skeletal muscle homeostasis via microbiota-dependent metabolites, thus representing the possible biological substratum for the sarcopenia onset. In fact, the rearrangements of gut microbiota as well as the alteration of its functions contribute at increasing the anabolic resistance, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, determining mitochondrial abnormalities with consequent oxidation, and causing insulin resistance. In this article, the link between gut microbiota and physical frailty is discussed. It is especially explained the role that sarcopenia may play in this likely bidirectional relationship.","[Casati, Martina; Ferri, Evelyn; Azzolino, Domenico; Cesari, Matteo; Arosio, Beatrice] Osped Maggiore Policlin, Fdn IRCCS Ca Granda, Geriatr Unit, Via Pace 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Azzolino, Domenico; Cesari, Matteo; Arosio, Beatrice] Univ Milan, Dept Clin Sci & Community Hlth, Via Pace 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy",,,2,SEP,2019,124,,10.1016/j.exger.2019.110639,Geriatrics & Gerontology

Establishment of a protective gut microbiota population offers a compelling therapeutic avenue, as brain injury induces disruptions in the composition of the gut microbiota, i.e., gut dysbiosis, which has been shown to contribute to TBI-related neuropathology and impaired behavioral outcomes. The gut microbiome is involved in the modulation of a multitude of cellular and molecular processes fundamental to the progression of TBI-induced pathologies including neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier permeability, immune system response, microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as intestinal motility and permeability. Additionally, gut dysbiosis further aggravates behavioral impairments in animal models of TBI and spinal cord injury, as well as negatively affects health outcomes in murine stroke models. Recent studies indicate that microbiota transplants and probiotics ameliorate neuroanatomical damage and functional impairments in animal models of stroke and spinal cord injury. In addition, probiotics have been shown to reduce the rate of infection and time spent in intensive care of hospitalized patients suffering from brain trauma. Perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota and its metabolite profile may also serve as potential diagnostic and theragnostic biomarkers for injury severity and progression. This review aims to address the etiological role of the gut microbiome in the biochemical, neuroanatomical, and behavioral/cognitive consequences of TBI, as well as explore the potential of gut microbiome manipulation in the form of probiotics as an effective therapeutic to ameliorate TBI-induced pathology and symptoms.","[Rice, Matthew W.; Pandya, Jignesh D.; Shear, Deborah A.] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Brain Trauma Neuroprotect Branch, Ctr Mil Psychiat & Neurosci, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command's Combat Casualty Care Research Program [H_001_2018_WRAIR],This effort was funded by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command's Combat Casualty Care Research Program (H_001_2018_WRAIR).,0,Aug-16,2019,10,,10.3389/fneur.2019.00875,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences

The objective of this research was to investigate the response of microbial community composition (phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity to fertilization treatments through a three-year experiment. Treatments were: Control (without fertilizer, CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), NPK + pig manure (NPKM), NPK + straw (NPKS), and NPK + both manure and straw (NPKMS). We found that fertilization had no effect on the microbial abundance except arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) PLFA. Soil microbial community composition was significantly affected by crop species and to a lesser extent by fertilization, with a greater influence on the wheat harvest. In addition, soil enzyme activities were enhanced by fertilization, especially in wheat season. Over three years, compared with NPK treatment, addition of organic manure or straw (NPKS and NPKMS) significantly increased the activities of the enzymes except invertase and urease, and the effect was greater at wheat harvest than the maize harvest. Our results indicate that the response of soil microbial community structure and enzyme activities to fertilization takes precedence than microbial biomass in the short term. The temporal variation in soil microbial community structure and enzyme activities in the crop rotation indicate that crop species may be carefully considered for sustainable agricultural intensification management.","[Zhang, Yunlong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yunlong; Li, Tengteng; Bei, Shuikuan; Zhang, Junling; Li, Xiaolin] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wu, Honghui] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr Key Lab Crop Nutr & Fertilizat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Postdoctoral Science Foundation of ChinaChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620965]; Inter-Governmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation [S2016G0053]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150500]; Chinese Ministry of AgricultureMinistry of Agriculture, China [201103004]","This research was funded by the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2017M620965), the Inter-Governmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation (S2016G0053), the National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB150500), and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (201103004).",0,AUG,2019,11,15,10.3390/su11154088,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies

This is accompanied by alterations in gut bacteria that may be ameliorated with synbiotics (pro- and prebiotics). Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are thought to have a role in the detoxification of ammonia. We investigated the effects of the administration of synbiotics and/or BCAAs in treating HE. Methods: Participants with overt HE were randomised in a blinded placebo-controlled study to receive synbiotics, BCAAs, or a combination of BCAAs and Synbiotics. Relevant biochemical and nutritional data and depression and anxiety scores (DASS-21) were collected at entry, 4 weeks, and on completion, at 8 weeks. The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Inhibitory Control Test (ICT) were used to assess cognitive function in patients withHE. Results were analysed using linear mixed effects regression analyses. Results: Sixty-one participants were enrolled and 49 who returned for at least 1 follow-up review were included in the intention to treat analysis. The mean age was 55.8 +/- 6.1 years and 86% were males. Despite evidence of a placebo effect, there was significant improvement in TMT B and ICT weighted lures in participants who received combined synbiotics/BCAAs treatment compared to placebo at study completion (p <= 0.05). Cognitive improvement occurred without a significant change in ammonia levels. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that combined synbiotics and BCAAs improve HE, and that may be beneficial in the management of HE. A larger study is needed to confirm these results.","[Vidot, Helen; Carey, Sharon] Royal Prince Alfred Hosp, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; [Vidot, Helen; Bowen, David G.; McCaughan, Geoffrey W.] Univ Sydney, Liver Injury & Canc Ctr, Centenary Res Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cvejic, Erin] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Finegan, Liam J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Shores, E.

Sri Lanka has experienced a doubling of the disease every 4 or 5 years since it was first identified in the North Central province in the mid-1990s. The disease primarily affects people in agricultural regions who are missing the commonly known risk factors for CKD. Sri Lanka is not alone: health workers have reported prevalence of CKDu in Mexico, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. A global search for the cause of CKDu has not identified a single factor, but rather many factors that may contribute to the etiology of the disease. Some of these factors include heat stroke leading to dehydration, toxic metals such as cadmium and arsenic, fluoride, low selenium, toxigenic cyanobacteria, nutritionally deficient diet and mycotoxins from mold exposure. Furthermore, exposure to agrichemicals, particularly glyphosate and paraquat, are likely compounding factors, and may be the primary factors. Here, we argue that glyphosate in particular is working synergistically with most of the other factors to increase toxic effects. We propose, further, that glyphosate causes insidious harm through its action as an amino acid analogue of glycine, and that this interferes with natural protective mechanisms against other exposures. Glyphosate's synergistic health effects in combination with exposure to other pollutants, in particular paraquat, and physical labor in the ubiquitous high temperatures of lowland tropical regions, could result in renal damage consistent with CKDu in Sri Lanka.","[Gunatilake, Sarath] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Hlth Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Seneff, Stephanie] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Orlando, Laura] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Quanta Computers, Taiwan, under Qmulus program","This research is supported in part by Quanta Computers, Taiwan, under the auspices of the Qmulus program.",1,Aug-01,2019,16,15,10.3390/ijerph16152734,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Here, we describe how etiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be regulated or disturbed by symbiotic microbial activity. Furthermore, the composition of symbiotic microbes has changed dramatically across human history alongside the rise of agriculturalism, industrialization, and globalization. We postulate that each of these lifestyle transitions engendered progressive depletion of microbial diversity and enhancement of virulence, thereby enhancing AD risk pathways. It is likely that the human life span extended into the eighth decade tens of thousands of years ago, yet little is known about premodern geriatric epidemiology. We propose that microbiota of the gut, oral cavity, nasal cavity, and brain may modulate AD pathogenesis, and that changes in the microbial composition of these body regions across history suggest escalation of AD risk. Dysbiosis may promote immunoregulatory dysfunction due to inadequate education of the immune system, chronic inflammation, and epithelial barrier permeability. Subsequently, proinflammatory agents-and occasionally microbes-may infiltrate the brain and promote AD pathogenic processes. APOE genotypes appear to moderate the effect of dysbiosis on AD risk. Elucidating the effect of symbiotic microbiota on AD pathogenesis could contribute to basic and translational research.","[Fox, Molly; Knorr, Delaney A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Anthropol, 341 Haines Hall,375 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fox, Molly] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Haptonstall, Kacey M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesAwardUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [K01 DK105110-01],M.F. was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesAward K01 DK105110-01.,1,AUG,2019,1449,1,10.1111/nyas.14129,Multidisciplinary Sciences

We checked the association between the gut microbiome and psychosocial stress in children/adolescents and investigated which stress parameter (negative versus positive emotion, self-report versus parental report, events versus emotions, biomarker cortisol versus parasympathetic activity) is the most relevant indicator herein. Methods: Gut microbiome sequencing was completed in fecal samples from 93 Belgian 8-16y olds. Stress measures included negative events, negative emotions, emotional problems reported by parents, happiness, hair cortisol and heart rate variability (pnn50 parameter reflecting parasympathetic activity). Alpha diversity, beta diversity and linear discriminant analysis were the unadjusted analyses. Age, sex, socio-economic status, diet, physical activity, sleep and weight status were adjusted for via a redundancy analysis and differential abundance via zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results: High stress as reflected by low pnn50 and more negative events were associated with a lower alpha diversity as indicated by the Simpson index. Happiness and pnn50 showed significant differences between high and low stress groups based on weighted UniFrac distance, and this remained significant after confounder adjustment. Adjusted and unadjusted taxonomic differences were also most pronounced for happiness and pnn50 being associated respectively with 24 OTU (=11.8% of bacterial counts) and 31 OTU (=13.0%). As a general pattern, high stress was associated with lower Firmicutes at the phylum level and higher Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Rhodococcus, Methanobrevibacter and Roseburia but lower Phascolarctobacterium at genus level. Several genera gave conflicting results between different stress measures e.g. Ruminococcaceae UCG014, Tenericutes, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Prevotella 9 and Christensenellaceae R7. Differential results in preadolescents versus adolescents were also evident. Conclusion: Even in this young healthy population, stress parameters were cross-sectionally associated with gut microbial composition but this relationship was instrument specific. Positive emotions and parasympathetic activity appeared the strongest parameters and should be integrated in future microbiota projects amongst other stress measures.","[Michels, Nathalie] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Van de Wiele, Tom] Univ Ghent, Fac Bioengn, Lab Microbial Ecol & Technol, Ghent, Belgium; [Fouhy, Fiona] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Fouhy, Fiona; O'Mahony, Siobhain; Clarke, Gerard; Keane, James] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [O'Mahony, Siobhain] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Michels, Nathalie] 4K3 De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Research Foundation - FlandersFWO [FWO.3E0.2015.0043.01]; Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in FlandersInstitute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) [SBO-120054]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), through the Irish Government's National Development PlanScience Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2273]","The authors want to thank the participating children and their parents for their voluntary participation.

However, the results of genetic research on schizophrenia have not yielded results consistent with that estimate of heritability. In particular, extensive genetic studies have not led to new methods for diagnosis and treatment. An examination of the twin studies on which heritability is based shows why such studies exaggerate the genetic component of schizophrenia. In addition, the effects of infectious agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and the composition of the microbiome can produce a clinical picture that would also appear to be largely genetic due to familial aggregation and a role for a partial genetic contribution to the immune system.

There is currently ample evidence on the role of epigenetics in developing various mental disorders. A burden of environmental pressure, such as psychological trauma, and its influence on genotype can lead to a variety of psychopathologies. Thus, this study focuses on the epigenetic activity of the complex protein machinery operating on chromatin - the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. Although there are several recent studies on the molecular structure, functions, and taxonomy of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, the focus of this paper is to highlight the importance of those 'protein machines' in developing psychiatric disorders. Data were obtained from human preclinical and clinical studies. The results of this review indicate an importance of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in the interaction between environmental factors, including traumatic events, and genetic vulnerability to stress. Several studies indicate that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes play a crucial role in the development and consolidation of memory, in neurodevelopmental processes, and in etiology depressive-like behavior. Thus, the activity of those 'protein machines' emerges as a key factor in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric diseases. It can also be concluded that the limitations of clinical studies may be explained by inappropriate laboratory methods and research paradigms due to the delayed timeframe of biochemical responses to environmental stimuli. Future research in this field may enable a better understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases and contribute to the development of novel molecular treatment targets.","[Bielawski, Tomasz; Frydecka, Dorota] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, 10 Pasteur St, PL-50367 Wroclaw, Poland; [Misiak, Blazej] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Genet, 1 Marcinkowski St, PL-50368 Wroclaw, Poland; [Moustafa, Ahmed] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Moustafa, Ahmed] Qatar Univ, Dept Social Sci, Ringgold Stand Inst, Doha, Qatar",,,2,AUG,2019,30,6,10.1515/revneuro-2018-0055,Neurosciences

The recognitions the human microbiome opens up for thinking about the biological self and the individual have ontological and epistemological ramifications for considering what and who the human being is. As this article illustrates, the microbiopolitics of the human microbiome challenges the immunitarian Pasteurian model in which the organismic self shores itself up and defends itself against a microbial non-self or other. Instead, this theory presents the human organism as comprised of multiple ecosystems and as a multitude, suggesting that the thanatopolitical attempts to wipe out microbial others (evident in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, for example) are giving way to an affirmative microbiopolitics grounded in generative multispecies relationality. This article sets out to make the case for this affirmative microbiopolitics.","[Ironstone, Penelope] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Ironstone, Penelope] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Grad Program Cultural Anal & Social Theory, Waterloo, ON, Canada",,,0,AUG,2019,22,3,10.1177/1368431018811330,Sociology

As such, interest in the role of the gut microbiome in psychiatric conditions has drawn immense interest. This is evidenced by the recent surge in published studies examining microbial dysbiosis in clinical psychiatric populations, particularly autism spectrum disorder and depression. However, critical examination of these studies reveals methodological flaws in design and execution, suggesting that they may not be held to the same standards as other bodies of clinical research. Given the complex nature of the gut microbiome, this narrative review attempts to clarify concepts critical to effectively examine its potential role in psychopathology to appropriately inform mental health researchers. More specifically, the numerous variables known to affect the gut microbiome are discussed, including inflammation, diet, weight, and medications. A comprehensive review of the extant microbiome literature in clinical psychiatric populations is also provided, in addition to clinical implications and suggestions for future directions of research. Although there is a clear need for additional studies to elucidate the gut microbiome's role in psychiatric disorders, there is an even greater need for well-designed, appropriately controlled studies to truly impact the field.","[Van Ameringen, Michael; Turna, Jasmine; Patterson, Beth; Anglin, Rebecca] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Van Ameringen, Michael; Turna, Jasmine; Patterson, Beth; Pipe, Amy; Mao, Randi Q.] McMaster Univ, MacAnxiety Res Ctr, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine] McMaster Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Pipe, Amy] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Med, Cork, Ireland; [Anglin, Rebecca; Surette, Michael G.] McMaster Univ, Farncombe Family Digest Hlth Researcth Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Anglin, Rebecca; Surette, Michael G.] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine] McMaster Univ, Peter Boris Ctr Addict Res, Michael G DeGroote Ctr Med Cannabis Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Turna, Jasmine] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Anglin, Rebecca] Univ Notre Dame, Sch Med, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Anglin, Rebecca] Univ Western Australia, Fiona Stanley Hosp, Nedlands, WA, Australia",,,1,NOV,2019,36,11,10.1002/da.22936,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry; Psychology"

African American infants disproportionately experience multiple, overlapping vulnerabilities such as preterm birth and formula rather than breast feeding that may disrupt the development of the infant microbiome. African American infants also are more likely to have mothers affected by chronic stress both pre- and post-natally. Perhaps relatedly, African American offspring are disproportionately affected by neurodevelopmental delays. Taken together, these findings suggest that one important mechanism that may link prenatal and postnatal stress and African American infant brain development is the composition of the infant microbiome. Methods: In our ongoing longitudinal study, Maternal Stress and the Gut-Brain Axis in African American Infants (R01MD009746), we investigate associations between maternal prenatal and postnatal stress and the composition of the infant gut microbiome, in relation to cognitive and social-emotional development. We aim to recruit 300 African American mother-infant dyads, contingent on the mother's previous participation in an associated prenatal cohort study: Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women (R01NR014800). Following enrollment, we assess infants at 1-week, and 3-, 6-, 12-and 18-months to collect: standardized assessments of infant neurocognitive and social-emotional development; questionnaire measures of infant feeding and health; observational data on maternal-infant interactions; maternal reports of postnatal stress; blood and saliva samples to evaluate maternal and infant psychoneuroimmunologic (PNI) function; and infant stool samples to characterize acquisition and trajectory of gut microbiome composition. Genetic variants of the major histocompatibility complex that may influence gut microbiome composition are also being evaluated. Discussion: This rich data set will allow future consideration of risk and protective factors that influence neurodevelopment in African American infants who are exposed to varying levels of prenatal and early life stress. Evidence for a mechanistic role of the microbiome would provide a framework for future clinical evaluations of preventative interventions (e.g., probiotics, culturally-appropriate breastfeeding campaigns) that could potentially improve the health and development of African American children in infancy and across the lifespan.","[Brennan, Patricia A.; Dunlop, Anne L.; Smith, Alicia K.; Kramer, Michael; Mulle, Jennifer; Corwin, Elizabeth J.] Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, 36 Eagle Row, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",National Institute on Minority Health and Health DisparitiesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD) [R01MD009746],"The cohort study described in this protocol is funded by National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities through Grant R01MD009746.

The fungus-farming higher' termite members of Macrotermitinae are also consumed by modern great apes and are implicated as critical dietary resources for early hominins. While the chemical nutritional composition of edible termites is well known, their microbiomes are unexplored in the context of human health. Here we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of gut microbiota extracted from the whole intestinal tract of two Macrotermes sp. soldiers collected from the Limpopo region of South Africa.ResultsMajor and minor soldier subcastes of M. falciger exhibit consistent differences in taxonomic representation, and are variable in microbial presence and abundance patterns when compared to another edible but less preferred species, M. natalensis. Subcaste differences include alternate patterns in sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Euryarchaeota abundance, and differences in abundance between Alistipes and Ruminococcaceae. M. falciger minor soldiers and M. natalensis soldiers have similar microbial profiles, likely from close proximity to the termite worker castes, particularly during foraging and fungus garden cultivation. Compared with previously published termite and cockroach gut microbiome data, the taxonomic representation was generally split between termites that directly digest lignocellulose and humic substrates and those that consume a more distilled form of nutrition as with the omnivorous cockroaches and fungus-farming termites. Lastly, to determine if edible termites may point to a shared reservoir for rare bacterial taxa found in the gut microbiome of humans, we focused on the genus Treponema. The majority of Treponema sequences from edible termite gut microbiota most closely relate to species recovered from other termites or from environmental samples, except for one novel OTU strain, which clustered separately with Treponema found in hunter-gatherer human groups.ConclusionsMacrotermes consumed by humans display special gut microbial arrangements that are atypical for a lignocellulose digesting invertebrate, but are instead suited to the simplified nutrition in the fungus-farmer diet. Our work brings to light the particular termite microbiome features that should be explored further as avenues in human health, agricultural sustainability, and evolutionary research.","[Schnorr, Stephanie L.] Konrad Lorenz Inst Evolut & Cognit Res, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Schnorr, Stephanie L.; Hofman, Courtney A.; Honap, Tanvi P.; Lewis, Cecil M.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Anthropol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Schnorr, Stephanie L.; Hofman, Courtney A.; Honap, Tanvi P.; Lewis, Cecil M.] Univ Oklahoma, Labs Mol Anthropol & Microbiome Res, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Schnorr, Stephanie L.] Univ Nevada, Dept Anthropol, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Netshifhefhe, Shandukani R.; Duncan, Frances D.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Netshifhefhe, Shandukani R.] Gauteng Dept Agr & Rural Dev, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lesnik, Julie] Wayne State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Detroit, MI USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R01GM089886-06],Funding came from NIH 5R01GM089886-06.,0,Jul-17,2019,19,,10.1186/s12866-019-1540-5,Microbiology

An increasing body of preclinical and clinical evidence has revealed that the gut microbial ecosystem can affect neuropsychiatric health.

Areas covered: To review the role of MGB axis in neuropsychiatric disorders, prediction and prevention of disease through exploitation, integration, and combination of data from existing gut microbiome/microbiota projects and appropriate other International '-Omics' studies. The authors also evaluated the new technological advances to investigate and modulate, through nutritional and other interventions, the gut microbiota. Expert opinion: The clinical studies have documented an association between alterations in gut microbiota composition and/or function, whereas the preclinical studies support a role for the gut microbiota in impacting behaviors which are of relevance to psychiatry and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Targeting MGB axis could be an additional approach for treating CNS disorders and all conditions in which alterations of the gut microbiota are involved.","[Iannone, Luigi Francesco; Citraro, Rita; Russo, Emilio] Univ Catanzaro, Sch Med, Sci Hlth Dept, Catanzaro, Italy; [Preda, Alberto; Minetti, Carlo; Striano, Pasquale] Univ Genoa, Dept Neurosci Rehabil Ophthalmol Genet Maternal &, Paediat Neurol & Musc Dis Unit, G Gaslini Inst, Genoa, Italy; [Blottiere, Herve M.] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Micalis Inst, Jouyen Josas, France; [Blottiere, Herve M.] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, MetaGenoPolis, Jouyen Josas, France; [Clarke, Gerard] Univ Coll Cork, Coll Med & Hlth, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Albani, Diego] IRCCS Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri, Dept Neurosci, Milan, Italy; [Belcastro, Vincenzo] St Anna Hosp, Dept Med, Neurol Unit, Como, Italy; [Carotenuto, Marco] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Cattaneo, Anna; Provasi, Stefania] IRCCS Fatebenefratelli, Biol Psychiat Lab, Brescia, Italy; [Ferraris, Cinzia; Tagliabue, Anna] Univ Pavia, Dept Publ Hlth Expt & Forens Med, Human Nutr & Eating Disorder Res Ctr, Pavia, Italy; [Ronchi, Francesca; Zimmermann, Jakob] Univ Bern, Dept Biomed Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Luongo, Gaia] Ordine Tecnol Alimentari Campania & Lazio, Naples, Italy; [Santocchi, Elisa] IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy; [Guiducci, Letizia] Inst Clin Physiol, Natl Res Council, Pisa, Italy; [Baldelli, Pietro] Univ Genoa, Sect Physiol, Dept Expt Med, Genoa, Italy; [Iannetti, Paola; Spalice, Alberto] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Pediat, Rome, Italy; [Pedersen, Sigrid] Oslo Univ Hosp, Div Clin Neurosci, Dept Refractory Epilepsy, Oslo, Norway; [Petretto, Andrea] Ist Giannina Gaslini, Lab Mass Spectrometry, Core Facil, Genoa, Italy; [Selmer, Kaja] Oslo Univ Hosp, Div Clin Neurosci, Dept Res & Dev, Osla, Norway; [Selmer, Kaja] Oslo Univ Hosp, Div Clin Neurosci, Dept Refractory Epilepsy, Osla, Norway; [Verrotti, Alberto] Univ Aquila, Dept Pediat, Laquila, Italy; [Segata, Nicola] Univ Trento, Ctr Integrat Biol, Trento, Italy; [Mainardi, Paolo] Kolfarma SRL, Genoa, Italy; [Giordano, Carmen] Politecn Milan, Dept Chem Mat & Chem Engn Giulio Natta, Milan, Italy; [Sisodiya, Sanjay] UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Clin & Expt Epilepsy, Queen Sq, London, England; [Zara, Federico] Ist Giannina Gaslini, Lab Neurogenet, Genoa, Italy",Kolfarma; Fb Health; Ecupharma; University of Genova,"The Gut-Brain-Microbiome connection in neuropsychiatric diseases of children and adults workshop (Genova, April 27-28th, 2018) was supported by Kolfarma, Fb Health, Ecupharma and by University of Genova (travel grant to PS).

However, there has been very limited scientific investigation into the potential biological connection. We performed a 10-week pilot study investigating the effects of a broad spectrum micronutrient administration on faecal microbiome content, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study consisted of 17 children (seven in the placebo and ten in the treatment group) between the ages of seven and 12 years, who were diagnosed with ADHD. We found that micronutrient treatment did not drive large-scale changes in composition or structure of the microbiome. However, observed OTUs significantly increased in the treatment group, and showed no mean change in the placebo group. The differential abundance and relative frequency of Actinobacteria significantly decreased post-micronutrient treatment, and this was largely attributed to species from the genus Bifidobacterium. This was compensated by an increase in the relative frequency of species from the genus Collinsella. Further research is required to establish the role that Bifidobacterium contribute towards neuropsychiatric disorders; however, these findings suggest that micronutrient administration could be used as a safe, therapeutic method to modulate Bifidobacterium abundance, which could have potential implications for modulating and regulating ADHD behaviour. Our pilot study provides an initial observation into this area of research, and highlights an interesting avenue for further investigation in a larger cohort. Furthermore, these novel results provide a basis for future research on the biological connection between ADHD, diet and the microbiome.","[Stevens, Aaron J.; Kennedy, Martin A.] Univ Otago Christchurch, Dept Pathol & Biomed Sci, POB 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Purcell, Rachel, V] Univ Otago Christchurch, Dept Surg, POB 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Darling, Kathryn A.; Rucklidge, Julia J.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Psychol, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Eggleston, Matthew J.

Identifying the underlying factors that contribute to addiction vulnerability may lead to more effective prevention strategies. Supply side environmental factors are a major contributing component. Psychosocial factors such as stress, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences have been linked to emotional pain leading to self-medication. Genetic and epigenetic factors associated with brain reward pathways and impulsivity are known predictors of addiction vulnerability. This review attempts to present a biopsychosocial approach that connects various social and biological theories related to the addiction crisis. The emerging role of nutrition therapy with an emphasis on gastrointestinal health in the treatment of opioid use disorder is presented. The biopsychosocial model integrates concepts from several disciplines, emphasizing multicausality rather than a reductionist approach. Potential solutions at multiple levels are presented, considering individual as well as population health. This single cohesive framework is based on the interdependency of the entire system, identifying risk and protective factors that may influence substance-seeking behavior. Nutrition should be included as one facet of a multidisciplinary approach toward improved recovery outcomes.

Dental calculus does not typically accumulate as much today as historically, and clinical oral microbiome research studies focus primarily on living dental plaque biofilm. However, plaque and calculus reflect different conditions of the oral biofilm, and the differences in microbial characteristics between the sample types have not yet been systematically explored. Here, we compare the microbial profiles of modern dental plaque, modern dental calculus, and historic dental calculus to establish expected differences between these substrates.ResultsMetagenomic data was generated from modern and historic calculus samples, and dental plaque metagenomic data was downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project. Microbial composition and functional profile were assessed. Metaproteomic data was obtained from a subset of historic calculus samples. Comparisons between microbial, protein, and metabolomic profiles revealed distinct taxonomic and metabolic functional profiles between plaque, modern calculus, and historic calculus, but not between calculus collected from healthy teeth and periodontal disease-affected teeth. Species co-exclusion was related to biofilm environment. Proteomic profiling revealed that healthy tooth samples contain low levels of bacterial virulence proteins and a robust innate immune response. Correlations between proteomic and metabolomic profiles suggest co-preservation of bacterial lipid membranes and membrane-associated proteins.ConclusionsOverall, we find that there are systematic microbial differences between plaque and calculus related to biofilm physiology, and recognizing these differences is important for accurate data interpretation in studies comparing dental plaque and calculus.","[Velsko, Irina M.; Frantz, Laurent A.

This mediated relationship was moderated by NFA. More specifically, NFA moderated the path between experienced disgust and regulatory attitudes but not that between message exposure and experienced disgust. The two dimensions of NFA played different moderating roles: Emotional approach amplified the relationship between disgust and the attitudinal outcome, whereas emotional avoidance attenuated it. The study furthers understanding about how NFA influences emotional processing and contributes to research on disgust as a relatively understudied discrete emotion.","[Sun, Ye; Yeo, Sara K.; McKasy, Meaghan] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Languages & Commun Bldg,255 South Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Shugart, Erika] Amer Soc Cell Biol, Bethesda, MD USA",American Society for Microbiology,This work was supported by the American Society for Microbiology.,1,Jul-04,2019,22,4,10.1080/15205436.2019.1565786,Communication

In this study we used electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of escitalopram/citalopram focusing on a set of 31 metabolites from neurotransmitter-related pathways. Overall, 290 unipolar patients with major depressive disorder were profiled at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of drug treatment. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD17) scores gauged depressive symptom severity. More significant metabolic changes were found after 8 weeks than 4 weeks post baseline. Within the tryptophan pathway, we noted significant reductions in serotonin (5HT) and increases in indoles that are known to be influenced by human gut microbial cometabolism. 5HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5HIAA), and the ratio of 5HIAA/5HT showed significant correlations to temporal changes in HRSD17 scores. In the tyrosine pathway, changes were observed in the end products of the catecholamines, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and vinylmandelic acid. Furthermore, two phenolic acids, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, produced through noncanconical pathways, were increased with drug exposure. In the purine pathway, significant reductions in hypoxanthine and xanthine levels were observed. Examination of metabolite interactions through differential partial correlation networks revealed changes in guanosine-homogentisic acid and methionine-tyrosine interactions associated with HRSD17. Genetic association studies using the ratios of these interacting pairs of metabolites highlighted two genetic loci harboring genes previously linked to depression, neurotransmission, or neurodegeneration. Overall, exposure to escitalopram/citalopram results in shifts in metabolism through noncanonical pathways, which suggest possible roles for the gut microbiome, \oxidative stress, and inflammation-related mechanisms.","[Bhattacharyya, Sudeepa; Luo, Chunqiao] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biomed Informat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Ahmed, Ahmed T.; Frye, Mark A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Psychiat & Psychol, Rochester, MN USA; [Arnold, Matthias; Mahmoudiandehkordi, Siamak; Louie, Gregory; Rush, A.

However, their presence is documented in many early human groups, various nonhuman primates and, increasingly, our hominin ancestors and relatives. In this study, we describe an antemortem lesion on the root of a Paranthropus robustus third molar from Drimolen, South Africa, which likely represents another example of caries in fossil hominins. Materials and Methods The molar, DNH 40, is dated to 2.0-1.5 Ma and displays a lesion on the mesial root surface, extending from the cementoenamel junction 3 mm down toward the apex. The position and severity of the lesion was macroscopically recorded and micro-CT scanned to determine the extent of dentine involvement. Results A differential diagnosis indicates root caries, as the lesion is indistinguishable from clinical examples. Although necrotic in appearance, external tertiary dentine is evident on a micro CT scan. Gingival recession and/or continuous eruption of the tooth as a result of extensive occlusal wear would have occurred to facilitate caries formation. Therefore, the lesion is likely linked to relative old age of this individual. Discussion This new example increases the total number of carious lesions described in P. robustus teeth to 10, on occlusal, interproximal, and now, root surfaces. Beyond the consumption of caries-causing food, caries formation would have also required the presence of requisite intraoral cariogenic bacteria in this individual and the species. Of interest, the presence of tertiary dentine on the outward surface suggests the DNH 40 lesion may have been arrested, that is, no longer active, perhaps relating to a change in diet or oral microbiome just prior to the individual's death.","[Towle, Ian; Irish, Joel D.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Riga, Alessandro; Dori, Irene; Menter, Colin; Moggi-Cecchi, Jacopo] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Florence, Italy; [Irish, Joel D.] Univ Witwatersrand, Evolutionary Studies Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Irish, Joel D.] Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr Excellence PaleoSci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Moggi-Cecchi, Jacopo] Univ Johannesburg, Palaeo Res Inst, Auckland Pk, South Africa",Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; National Research Foundation South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa,Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; National Research Foundation South Africa,1,OCT,2019,170,2,10.1002/ajpa.23891,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

The next generation sequencing method enabled us to determine the microorganisms common to three Fluvisols, and we identified bacteria specific to individual soils. These results corresponded with the data obtained through EcoPlate (TM), indicating that the structural diversity and metabolic potential of the microbiome does not always depend on soil quality parameters.

Both petroleum products were administered in doses of 0 and 7 cm(3) kg(-1) soil d.m. Vegetation of Elymus elongatus spanned for 105 days. Grasses were harvested three times, i.e., on day 45, 75, and 105 of the experiment. The study results demonstrated a stronger toxic effect of DO than of P on the growth and development of Elymus elongatus. Diesel oil caused greater changes in soil microbiome compared to unleaded petroleum. This hypothesis was additionally confirmed by Shannon and Simpson indices computed based on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance, whose values were the lowest in the DO-polluted soil. Soil pollution with DO reduced the counts of all bacterial taxa and stimulated the activity of soil enzymes, whereas soil pollution with P diminished the diversity of bacteria only at the phylum, class, order, and family levels, but significantly suppressed the enzymatic activity. More polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were degraded in the soil polluted with P compared to DO, which may be attributed to the stimulating effect of Elymus elongatus on this process, as it grew better in the soil polluted with P than in that polluted with DO.","[Borowik, Agata; Wyszkowska, Jadwiga; Kucharski, Miroslaw; Kucharski, Jan] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microbiol, PL-10727 Olsztyn, Poland","National Science Centre Poland (NCN) [MINIATURA 1 2017/01/X/NZ9/00728]; Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland;  [010/RID/2018/19]","This study was supported by the National Science Centre Poland (NCN) under Grant MINIATURA 1 2017/01/X/NZ9/00728 and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds for statutory activity.

However, the comparative models used to date have mainly included a limited set of closely related primates. To further understand the forces that shape the primate gut microbiome, with reference to human populations, we expanded the comparative analysis of variation among gut microbiome compositions and their primate hosts, including 9 different primate species and 4 human groups characterized by a diverse set of subsistence patterns (n = 448 samples). The results show that the taxonomic composition of the human gut microbiome, at the genus level, exhibits increased compositional plasticity. Specifically, we show unexpected similarities between African Old World monkeys that rely on eclectic foraging and human populations engaging in nonindustrial subsistence patterns; these similarities transcend host phylogenetic constraints. Thus, instead of following evolutionary trends that would make their microbiomes more similar to that of conspecifics or more phylogenetically similar apes, gut microbiome composition in humans from nonindustrial populations resembles that of generalist cercopithecine monkeys. We also document that wild cercopithecine monkeys with eclectic diets and humans following nonindustrial subsistence patterns harbor high gut microbiome diversity that is not only higher than that seen in humans engaging in industrialized lifestyles but also higher compared to wild primates that typically consume fiber-rich diets. IMPORTANCE The results of this study indicate a discordance between gut microbiome composition and evolutionary history in primates, calling into question previous notions about host genetic control of the primate gut microbiome. Microbiome similarities between humans consuming nonindustrialized diets and monkeys characterized by subsisting on eclectic, omnivorous diets also raise questions about the ecological and nutritional drivers shaping the human gut microbiome. Moreover, a more detailed understanding of the factors associated with gut microbiome plasticity in primates offers a framework to understand why humans following industrialized lifestyles have deviated from states thought to reflect human evolutionary history. The results also provide perspectives for developing therapeutic dietary manipulations that can reset configurations of the gut microbiome to potentially improve human health.","[Gomez, Andres; Sharma, Ashok Kumar] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anim Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mallott, Elizabeth K.; Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.; Pafco, Barbora; Vlckova, Klara] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.; Modry, David] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Liberec Zoo, Liberec, Czech Republic; [Robinson, Carolyn A.

Alterations in the relative numbers of gut microbiota may contribute to such a disruption in normal bacterial diversity. It is assumed that this process may be adequately mirrored for the purpose of the current paper by modeling the dynamic shifts in the numbers of three bacterial species, namely Clostridium Desulfovibrio, and Bifidobacterium. Such imbalances in the gut microbiome are thought to promote the development of increased gut permeability (the so-called ""leaky gut"") which in turn is a potential risk factor for the development of ASD. Methods: We constructed a mathematical model using 2-D Cellular Automata to simulate the growth rates and interactions of three bacterial species, namely Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Desulfovibrio, with each other and with available nutrients in the gut, and particularly following the introduction of lysozyrne into the gut. Results: It was observed from the modeled simulation that increasing or decreasing the population of Clostridium in the gut produces key shifts in the gut microbiome which could potentially increase or decrease the risk of ASD. Conclusion: Simulations using our cellular automaton model suggest that it could be useful in predicting the effects produced by alterations to key components of the gut microbiome. In particular, the model demonstrated that the introduction of lysozyme in the gut results in steep reductions in Clostridium growth rate, which in turn could potentially alter the gut microbiome population in such a way as to significantly reduce the risk of developing ASD.","[Nagaraju, K.; Sudeep, K.

Aging is associated with reduced microbiota biodiversity, increased inter-individual variability, and over-representation of pathobionts, and these phenomena may have great relevance for skeletal muscle mass and function. For this reason, the presence of a gut-muscle axis regulating the onset and progression of age-related physical frailty and sarcopenia has been recently hypothesized. In this narrative review, we summarize the studies supporting a possible association between gut microbiota-related parameters with measures of muscle mass, muscle function, and physical performance in animal models and humans. Reduced muscle mass has been associated with distinct microbiota composition and reduced fermentative capacity in mice, and the administration of probiotics or butyrate to mouse models of muscle wasting has been associated with improved muscle mass. However, no studies have targeted the human microbiome associated with sarcopenia. Limited evidence from human studies shows an association between microbiota composition, involving key taxa such as Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and grip strength. Similarly, few studies conducted on patients with parkinsonism showed a trend towards a different microbiota composition in those with reduced gait speed. No studies have assessed the association of fecal microbiota with other measures of physical performance. However, several studies, mainly with a cross-sectional design, suggest an association between microbiota composition and frailty, mostly assessed according to the deficit accumulation model. Namely, frailty was associated with reduced microbiota biodiversity, and lower representation of butyrate-producing bacteria. Therefore, we conclude that the causal link between microbiota and physical fitness is still uncertain due to the lack of targeted studies and the influence of a large number of covariates, including diet, exercise, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, on both microbiota composition and physical function in older age. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and physical function remains a very promising area of research for the future.","[Ticinesi, Andrea; Nouvenne, Antonio; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Catania, Pamela; Prati, Beatrice; Tana, Claudio; Meschi, Tiziana] Azienda Osped Univ Parma, Geriatr Rehabil Dept, Via Antonio Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Ticinesi, Andrea; Nouvenne, Antonio; Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Microbiome Res Hub, Parco Area Sci 11-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Via Antonio Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy",,,2,JUL,2019,11,7,10.3390/nu11071633,Nutrition & Dietetics

Children with ASD are also at a higher risk for developing overweight or obesity than children with typical development (TD). Childhood obesity has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including insulin resistance, diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Importantly some key factors that play a mediating role in these higher rates of obesity include lifestyle factors and biological influences, as well as secondary comorbidities and medications. This review summarizes current knowledge about behavioral and lifestyle factors that could contribute to unhealthy weight gain in children with ASD, as well as the current state of knowledge of emerging risk factors such as the possible influence of sleep problems, the gut microbiome, endocrine influences and maternal metabolic disorders. We also discuss some of the clinical implications of these risk factors and areas for future research.","[Dhaliwal, Khushmol K.; Haqq, Andrea M.; Zwaigenbaum, Lonnie] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Pediat, 11405 87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada; [Orsso, Camila E.; Richard, Caroline; Haqq, Andrea M.] Univ Alberta, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Food & Nutr Sci, Agr Forestry Ctr 2 06, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada",Autism Research Centre Graduate Student Pilot Grant; Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation Clinical Research Grant; Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation Chair in Autism; Alberta Diabetes Institute; 2018 Alberta SPOR Graduate Studentship in Patient-Oriented Research - Alberta Innovates; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation in Autism; Stollery Science Lab; Autism Edmonton,"The authors express sincerely thanks to Autism Edmonton and the Autism Research Centre (at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton, AB).

We describe sociodemographic variation of oral microbiomes in a diverse sample. Methods: We performed 16S rRNA sequencing on mouthwash specimens in a subsample (n = 282) of the 2013-2014 population-based New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Study. We examined differential abundance of 216 operational taxonomic units, and alpha and beta diversity by age, sex, income, education, nativity, and race/ethnicity. For comparison, we examined differential abundance by diet, smoking status, and oral health behaviors. Results: Sixty-nine operational taxonomic units were differentially abundant by any sociodemographic variable (false discovery rate < 0.01), including 27 by race/ethnicity, 21 by family income, 19 by education, 3 by sex. We found 49 differentially abundant by smoking status, 23 by diet, 12 by oral health behaviors. Genera differing for multiple sociodemographic characteristics included Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium. Conclusions: We identified oral microbiome variation consistent with health inequalities, more taxa differing by race/ethnicity than diet, and more by SES variables than oral health behaviors. Investigation is warranted into possible mediating effects of the oral microbiome in social disparities in oral and metabolic diseases and cancers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Social interactions can affect the composition and function of the microbiome; conversely, the microbiome affects social communication by influencing the hosts' central nervous system and peripheral chemical communication. These discoveries set the stage for novel research focusing on the evolution and physiology of animal social behaviour in relation to microbial transmission strategies. Here, we discuss the emerging roles of teleost fish models and their potential for advancing research fields, linked to sociality and microbial regulation. We argue that fish models, such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio, Cyprinidae), sticklebacks (left-to-right markGasterosteidae), guppies (Poeciliidae) and cleaner-client dyads (e.g., obligate cleaner fish from the Labridae and Gobiidae families and their visiting clientele), will provide valuable insights into the roles of microbiome in shaping social behaviour and vice versa, while also being of direct relevance to the food and ornamental fish trades. The diversity of fish behaviour warrants more interdisciplinary research, including microbiome studies, which should have a strong ecological (field-derived) approach, together with laboratory-based cognitive and neurobiological experimentation. The implications of such integrated approaches may be of translational relevance, opening new avenues for future investigation using fish models.","[Soares, Marta C.; Xavier, Raquel] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Vairao, Portugal; [Cable, Jo] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Lima-Maximino, Monica G.] Univ Estado Para, DMCF, Maraba, Brazil; [Maximino, Caio] Univ Fed Sul & Sudeste Para, IESB, Unidade 3, Maraba, Brazil","FCT under the Programa Operacional Poten-cial Humano-Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional funds from the European Social Fund; Portuguese Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia [SFRH/BPD/109433/2015, IF/00359/2015]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through COMPETE programmeEuropean Union (EU); National Funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/MAR-BIO/0902/2014-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016550, PTDC/BIA-MIC/27995/2017-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-027995, PTDC/MAR/105276/2008]; Welsh Government and Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) AquaWales Project through the Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon Energy and Environment (NRN-LCEE); CNPq/BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [400726/2016-5, 423735/2016-0]",MCS and RX are currently supported by FCT under the Programa Operacional Poten-cial Humano-Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional funds from the European Social Fund and Portuguese Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia (MCS: SFRH/BPD/109433/2015; RX: IF/00359/2015).

Documenting optimal data/biospecimen collection protocols and scale properties are fundamental for elucidating the impact of psychosocial factors on biologic systems and ultimately cancer development/progression. Methods Between 2013 and 2014, 233 Nurses' Health Study II women (mean age: 60.6) participated in the Mind-Body Study. Participants completed a detailed online psychosocial assessment and provided hair, toenail, timed saliva over 1 day, urine and fasting blood twice, 1 year apart. Additionally, two separate microbiome collections for stool and saliva were conducted between the psychosocial assessments. We assessed correlations between various psychosocial measures and evaluated their 1-year reproducibility using intraclass correlations (ICC). Results Compliance with the protocols was high among participants. Psychosocial measures showed moderate-to-high reproducibility over 1 year (ICCs = 0.51-0.81). There was clear clustering of psychosocial factors according to whether they were querying positive (e.g., optimism, mastery, mindfulness) or negative (e.g., anxiety, depression, discrimination) emotion-related or social constructs. Conclusion Results suggest feasibility for self-administered collection of various biospecimens and moderate-to-high reproducibility of psychosocial factors. The Mind-Body Study provides a unique resource for assessing inter-relationships between psychosocial factors and biological processes linked with long-term health outcomes, including carcinogenesis.","[Huang, Tianyi; Poole, Elizabeth M.; Hankinson, Susan E.; Okereke, Olivia I.; Tworoger, Shelley S.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Div Network Med, 181 Longwood Ave,Rm 432, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Huang, Tianyi; Poole, Elizabeth M.; Hankinson, Susan E.; Okereke, Olivia I.; Tworoger, Shelley S.] Harvard Med Sch, 181 Longwood Ave,Rm 432, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Huang, Tianyi] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Trudel-Fitzgerald, Claudia; Kubzansky, Laura D.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Boston, MA USA; [Sawyer, Sherylin] Brigham & Womens Hosp, BWH Harvard Cohorts Biorepository, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hankinson, Susan E.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Sci, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Hankinson, Susan E.; Okereke, Olivia I.; Tworoger, Shelley S.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA; [Okereke, Olivia I.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tworoger, Shelley S.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Canc Epidemiol, Tampa, FL USA","National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 CA163451, UM1 CA176726]; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [W81XWH-13-1-0493]; American Heart Association postdoctoral fellowshipAmerican Heart Association [16POST27480007]; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - SanteFonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec",We thank the participants and the staff of the Nurses' Health Study II for their valuable contributions.

Of patients who have a mental-health condition, more than half also have a physical disease, and these cases are associated with increased human suffering and societal cost. Comorbidity research to date has focused on co-occurring mental- and physical-health disorders separately, and relatively little research has examined the co-occurrence of mental- and physical-health dysfunction. In addition, even less is known about why mental- and physical-health dysfunction co-occurs or how to treat these cases. Thus, the aims of this article are to highlight the need for research at the intersection of physical- and mental-health dysfunction and to provide guidance on how to research cases of comorbidity. Toward these ends, we begin by presenting a selective overview of the possible role of biological processes in the co-occurrence of physical- and mental-health dysfunction using specific illustrative examples. Specifically, we outline how biological processes within the immune system and gastrointestinal system could underlie depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and their co-occurrence. We then advance and discuss a proposed research framework, including methodological and analytic guidance, that researchers could use when studying the phenomenon of co-occurring physical- and mental-health dysfunction.","[Hagerty, Sarah L.; Ellingson, Jarrod M.; Helmuth, Timothy B.; Hutchison, Kent E.; Bryan, Angela D.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO USA; [Bidwell, L.

Female health care workers employed on a rotating-shift schedule (n = 41) completed baseline anthropometric assessments; a fasted blood draw; questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Survey); and an exercise fatigue test. Identical post-tests occurred following 6 weeks of daily supplementation with placebo (PLA) or probiotics (2.5 x 10(9) CFU/g) containing 9 bacterial strains (PRO; Ecologic Barrier) combined with a prebiotic carrier matrix. PRO attenuated fat mass increases (change (Delta), 0.14 kg; confidence interval (CI) - 0.46 to 0.75 kg) compared with PLA (Delta, 0.79 kg; CI 0.03-1.54 kg), whereas modest reductions in visceral adiposity resulted for both PRO and PLA. Metabolic biomarkers (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, glucose, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leptin) were not influenced by either treatment (p > 0.05). Nonsignificant, but potentially clinically relevant, improvements in anxiety (Delta, -2.3 +/- 2.63) and fatigue (Delta, -4.8 +/- 5.5) were observed with PRO; exercise performance was unaffected.

NICU stress exposure data were collected daily for 6 weeks. V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Zero-inflated beta regression model with random effects was used to assess the impact of stress on gut microbiome trajectories. Week of sampling was significant for Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Proteus, Streptococcus, Clostridium butyricum, and Clostridium perfringens. Antibiotic usage was significant for Proteus, Citrobacter, and C. perfringens. Gender was significant for Proteus. Stress exposure occurring 1 and 2 weeks prior to sampling had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella. NICU stress exposure had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella.

Herein, we review animal and human evidence consistent with this hypothesis before advancing the novel idea that infant intestinal microbiota may be one candidate mechanism for instantiating developmental plasticity as a result of prenatal stress. We then review research indicating that prenatal stress predicts differences in infant intestinal microbiota; that infant intestinal microbiota is associated with behavioral and physiological reactivity phenotypes; and, thus, that prenatal stress may influence infant intestinal microbiota in a way that results in heightened physiological and behavioral reactivity and, thereby, postnatal developmental plasticity.

There are parallel early developmental windows for the gut microbiota and the nervous system during prenatal to postnatal of life. Therefore, preterm infants represent a unique population in which optimization of initial colonization and microbiota development can affect brain development and enhance neurological outcomes. In this review, we will first discuss the factors affecting the assembly of neonatal gut microbiota and the contribution of dysbiosis in preterm infants to neuroinflammation and neurodevelopmental disorders. We then will discuss the emerging pathways connecting the gut microbiome and brain development. Further we will discuss the significance of current models for alteration of the gut microbiome (including humanized gnotobiotic models and exposure to antibiotics) to brain development and functions.

Even less is known about how the development of the gut microbiome influences critical periods of neural and behavioral development, particularly adolescence. In this review, we first discuss why the gut microbiome has become increasingly relevant to developmental cognitive neuroscience and provide a synopsis of the known connections of the gut microbiome with social-affective brain function and behavior, specifically highlighting human developmental work when possible. We then focus on adolescence, a key period of neurobiological and social-affective development. Specifically, we review the links between the gut microbiome and six overarching domains of change during adolescence: (a) social processes, (b) motivation and behavior, (c) neural development, (d) cognition, (e) neuroendocrine function, and (f) physical health and wellness. Using a developmental science perspective, we summarize key changes across these six domains to underscore the promise for the gut microbiome to bidirectionally influence and transform adolescent development.","[Flannery, Jessica; Fisher, Philip; Pfeifer, Jennifer] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Callaghan, Bridget] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Sharpton, Thomas] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [P50 DA035763]; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH107418],,3,JUL,2019,61,5,10.1002/dev.21821,Developmental Biology; Psychology

Although the etiopathogenesis of T2D remains poorly understood, advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed for sophisticated interrogation of the human microbiome, providing insight into the role of the gut microbiome in the development and progression of T2D. An emerging body of research reveals that gut-brain axis (GBA) perturbations and a high-fat diet (HFD), along with other modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, contribute to gut microbiome homeostatic imbalance. Homeostatic imbalance or disruption increases gut wall permeability and facilitates translocation of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) into the circulation with resultant systemic inflammation. Chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation ensues with pro-inflammatory pathways activated, contributing to obesity, insulin resistance (IR), pancreatic beta-cell decline, and, thereby, T2D. While GBA perturbations and HFD are implicated in provoking these conditions, prior mechanistic models have tended to examine HFD and GBA pathways exclusively without considering their shared pathways to T2D. Addressing this gap, this article proposes a mechanistic model informed by animal and human studies to advance scientific understanding of (1) modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for gut microbiome homeostatic disruption, (2) HFD and GBA pathways contributing to homeostatic disruption, and (3) shared GBA and HFD pro-inflammatory pathways to obesity, IR, beta-cell decline, and T2D. The proposed mechanistic model, based on the extant literature, proposes a framework for studying the complex relationships of the gut microbiome to T2D to advance study in this promising area of research.","[Lew, Kelley Newlin; Starkweather, Angela; Cong, Xiaomei; Judge, Michelle] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, 231 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",,,0,JUL,2019,21,4,10.1177/1099800419849109,Nursing

Methods: Twenty-one black adolescent women were sampled longitudinally. The composition of their vaginal communities was determined by analyzing the sequences of the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes, and they were grouped based on patterns in species abundances. The relationships between estradiol, glycogen, psychosocial stress, and the composition of these communities were assessed. Results: Vaginal communities could be distinguished and classified into three groups that differed in the abundances of Lactobacillus. Eighty-one percent of study participants had communities dominated by species of Lactobacillus. Glycogen levels were higher in communities dominated by one or multiple species of Lactobacillus compared with those having low proportions of Lactobacillus. Estradiol and psychosocial stress measurements did not differ among the three groups, whereas estradiol and glycogen exhibited a weak positive relationship that was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study suggest that glycogen levels are associated with vaginal community composition in young black women; however, estradiol and psychosocial stress are not. In addition, the results suggest there is no simple relationship between levels of estradiol and the production of vaginal glycogen. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

However, there is little data as to how the composition of infants' households may play a role, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. Here, we examined relationships between infant fecal microbiome (IFM) diversity/composition and infants' household size, number of siblings, and number of other household members. Materials and methods We analyzed 377 fecal samples from healthy, breastfeeding infants across 11 sites in eight different countries (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Fecal microbial community structure was determined by amplifying, sequencing, and classifying (to the genus level) the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Surveys administered to infants' mothers identified household members and composition. Results Our results indicated that household composition (represented by the number of cohabitating siblings and other household members) did not have a measurable impact on the bacterial diversity, evenness, or richness of the IFM. However, we observed that variation in household composition categories did correspond to differential relative abundances of specific taxa, namely: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. Discussion This study, to our knowledge, is the largest cross-cultural study to date examining the association between household composition and the IFM. Our results indicate that the social environment of infants (represented here by the proxy of household composition) may influence the bacterial composition of the infant GIM, although the mechanism is unknown. A higher number and diversity of cohabitants and potential caregivers may facilitate social transmission of beneficial bacteria to the infant gastrointestinal tract, by way of shared environment or through direct physical and social contact between the maternal-infant dyad and other household members. These findings contribute to the discussion concerning ways by which infants are influenced by their social environments and add further dimensionality to the ongoing exploration of social transmission of gut microbiota and the ""old friends"" hypothesis.","[Lane, Avery A.; Hagen, Edward H.; Flores, Katherine E.; Meehan, Courtney L.] Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [McGuire, Michelle K.; Lackey, Kimberly A.] Univ Idaho, Sch Family & Consumer Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Gindola, Debela; Gebeyehu, Dubale] Univ Idaho, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Foster, James A.] Washington State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Sellen, Daniel W.] Hawassa Univ, Dept Anthropol, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Kamau-Mbuthia, Elizabeth W.; Kamundia, Egidioh W.; Mbugua, Samwel] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Moore, Sophie E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Moore, Sophie E.; Prentice, Andrew M.] Egerton Univ, Dept Human Nutr, Nakuru, Kenya; [Prentice, Andrew M.] Kings Coll London, Dept Women & Childrens Hlth, London, England; [Kvist, Linda J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, MRC Unit Gambia, Banjul, Gambia; [Otoo, Gloria E.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, MRC Int Nutr Grp, London, England; [Kvist, Linda J.] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Lund, Sweden; [Otoo, Gloria E.] Univ Ghana, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Rodriguez, Juan M.; Ruiz, Lorena] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz, Lorena] CSIC, Dept Microbiol & Biochem Dairy Prod, Inst Prod Lacteos Asturias, Villaviciosa, Spain; [Pareja, Rossina G.] Inst Invest Nutr, Lima, Peru; [Pareja, Rossina G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bode, Lars] Univ Calif San Diego, Mother Milk Infant Ctr Res Excellence MOMI CORE, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Price, William J.] Univ Idaho, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Stat Programs, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1344288]; National Institutes of Health COBRE Phase III GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P30GM103324ide],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1344288; National Institutes of Health COBRE Phase III Grant, Grant/Award Number: P30GM103324ide.",1,JUL,2019,169,3,10.1002/ajpa.23843,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

However, the influence of individual host traits such as age and sex, given specific dietary and social constraints, has been less studied. The objective of this investigation was to determine the associations between an individual's age and sex on the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in wild western lowland gorillas. Materials and Methods Publicly available 16S rRNA data generated from fecal samples of different groups of Gorilla gorilla gorilla in the Central African Republic were downloaded and bioinformatically processed. The groups analyzed included habituated, partially habituated and unhabituated gorillas, sampled during low fruit (dry, n = 28) and high fruit (wet, n = 82) seasons. Microbial community analyses (alpha and beta diversity and analyses of discriminant taxa), in tandem with network-wide approaches, were used to (a) mine for specific age and sex based differences in gut bacterial community composition and to (b) asses for gut community modularity and bacterial taxa with potential functional roles, in the context of seasonal food variation, and social group affiliation. Results Both age and sex significantly influenced gut microbiome diversity and composition in wild western lowland gorillas. However, the largest differences were observed between infants and adults in habituated groups and between adults and immature gorillas within all groups, and across dry and wet seasons. Specifically, although adults always showed greater bacterial richness than infants and immature gorillas, network-wide analyses showed higher microbial community complexity and modularity in the infant gorilla gut. Sex-based microbiome differences were not evident among adults, being only detected among immature gorillas. Conclusions The results presented point to a dynamic gut microbiome in Gorilla spp., associated with ontogeny and individual development. Of note, the gut microbiomes of breastfeeding infants seemed to reflect early exposure to complex, herbaceous vegetation. Whether increased compositional complexity of the infant gorilla gut microbiome is an adaptive response to an energy-limited diet and an underdeveloped gut needs to be further tested. Overall, age and sex based gut microbiome differences, as shown here, maybe mainly attributed to access to specific feeding sources, and social interactions between individuals within groups.","[Pafco, Barbora; Petrzelkova, Klara J.; Vlckova, Klara] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Pafco, Barbora; Vlckova, Klara] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci Brno, Dept Pathol & Parasitol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Sharma, Ashok K.; Gomez, Andres] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Anim Sci, St Paul, MN USA; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Vlckova, Klara] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Microbiol & APC Microbiome Ireland, Food Sci Bldg, Cork, Ireland; [Todd, Angelique] WWF CAR, Bangui, Cent Afr Republ; [Yeoman, Carl J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Wilson, Brenda A.; Stumpf, Rebecca; White, Bryan A.; Leigh, Steven] Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL USA; [Wilson, Brenda A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Microbiol, 131 Burrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Stumpf, Rebecca] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 109 Davenport Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Nelson, Karen E.] J Craig Venter Inst, La Jolla, CA USA; [Leigh, Steven] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0935347]; Fulbright research scholarship; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO: 68081766]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LH15175]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 0935347; Fulbright research scholarship; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: RVO: 68081766; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic, Grant/Award Number: LH15175",1,JUL,2019,169,3,10.1002/ajpa.23842,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

However, in many cases, second-generation antipsychotics have unwanted side effects, such as weight gain, potentially further increasing risk for morbidities including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. While various mechanisms for this weight gain have been proposed, including effects on metabolic hormone signaling, recent evidence points to the importance of the gut microbiome in this process. The microbial communities residing within the gut are affected by second-generation antipsychotics and can confer weight gain.Main textThis review summarizes recent findings and presents data linking second-generation antipsychotics, gut microbiota alterations and weight gain. The review focuses on children and adolescent populations, which have not previously received much attention, but are of great interest because they may be most vulnerable to gut microbiome changes and may carry long-term metabolic effects into adulthood.ConclusionsWe present correlations between second-generation antipsychotics, gut microbiota alterations and weight gain, and suggest some mechanisms that may link them. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms may lead to the design of improved treatments for psychotic disorders with fewer harmful side effects.","[Bretler, Tali; Neuman, Hadar] Ziv Med Ctr, Derech Harambam St, IL-13100 Safed, Israel; [Weisberg, Hagar; Koren, Omry] Bar Ilan Univ, Azrieli Fac Med, 8 Henrietta Szold St, IL-1311502 Safed, Israel; [Neuman, Hadar] Zefat Acad Coll, 11 Jerusalem St, IL-1320611 Safed, Israel",,,1,Jun-19,2019,17,,10.1186/s12916-019-1346-1,"Medicine, General & Internal"

The available evidence suggests that intensive 3-monthly screening in this setting does not have a large effect on the prevalence of these infections but results in high antimicrobial exposures. Gonorrhea/chlamydia screening may thus be doing more harm than good. Compelling arguments can, however, be made to screen for HIV, hepatitis C, and syphilis in PrEP cohorts. In this perspective piece, we explore the logical basis for deciding which STIs to screen for in PrEP cohorts. We propose that a Delphi consensus methodology is used to derive, assess, and apply a broadly accepted set of criteria to evaluate which STIs to screen for in these cohorts. Finally, to illustrate the utility of the process, we derive and apply our own list of criteria as to which STIs to screen for. This process leads to a controversial conclusion, namely that stopping gonorrhea/chlamydia screening in a controlled and phased manner may offer net health benefits to PrEP cohorts.","[Kenyon, Chris] Inst Trop Med, HIV STI Unit, Antwerp, Belgium; [Kenyon, Chris] Univ Cape Town, Div Infect Dis & HIV Med, Cape Town, South Africa",,,0,Jun-12,2019,7,,10.3389/fpubh.2019.00154,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Our microbiomes are extraordinarily complex, and this complexity has been linked to human health and well-being. Given the complexity and importance of our microbiomes, we struggle with how to think about them. There is a long list of competing metaphors that we use to refer to our microbiomes, including as an organ containing our second genome, as a symbiont in the human holobiont, and as an ecological community in the human ecosystem, among others. Each of these makes different assumptions about the fundamental biology of the human-microbe system, with important implications for how we choose to study microbiomes, and the therapies we envision for correcting microbiome-linked disorders. We believe that it is time to move beyond metaphors, and we propose a scientifically pluralist approach that focuses on characterizing fundamental biological properties of microbiomes such as heritability, transmission mode, rates of dispersal rates, and strength of local selection. Such an approach will allow us to break out of the confines of narrow conceptual frameworks, and to guide the exploration of our complexity as chimeric beings.","[Morar, Nicolae] Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, Dept Philosophy, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Bohannan, Brendan J.

However, such pitfalls as spurious identification of pathogens based on fragmentary data or environmental contamination could lead to incorrect epidaemiological conclusions. Within the Mycobacterium genus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members responsible for tuberculosis share up to similar to 99% genomic sequence identity, while other more distantly related Mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis can be causative agents for pulmonary diseases or soil dwellers. Therefore, reliable determination of species complex is crucial for interpretation of sequencing results. Results: Here we present a novel bioinformatical approach, used for screening of ancient tuberculosis in sequencing data, derived from 28 individuals (dated 4400-4000 and 3100-2900 BC) from central Poland. We demonstrate that cost-effective next-generation screening sequencing data (similar to 20M reads per sample) could yield enough information to provide statistically supported identification of probable ancient disease cases. Conclusions: Application of appropriate bioinformatic tools, including an unbiased selection of genomic alignment targets for species specificity, makes it possible to extract valid data from full-sample sequencing results (without subjective targeted enrichment procedures). This approach broadens the potential scope of palaeoepidaemiology both to older, suboptimally preserved samples and to pathogens with difficult intrageneric taxonomy.","[Borowka, Paulina; Borowska-Struginska, Beata; Zadzinska, Elzbieta; Lorkiewicz, Wieslaw] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Anthropol, 12-16 Banacha St, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Pulaski, Lukasz] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Mol Biophys, 12-16 Banacha St, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Pulaski, Lukasz; Dziadek, Jaroslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Med Biol, 106 Lodowa St, PL-93232 Lodz, Poland; [Marciniak, Blazej; Strapagiel, Dominik] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Mol Biophys, Biobank Lab, 14 Pilarskiego St, PL-90231 Lodz, Poland; [Marciniak, Blazej; Strapagiel, Dominik] BBMRI Pl Consortium, 147 Stablowicka St, PL-54066 Wroclaw, Poland","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grantMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [DIR/WK/2017/01]; Polish POPC Grant from the European Regional Development Fund [02.03.01-00-0012/17-00]",The study was financed by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant DIR/WK/2017/01 and by the Polish POPC Grant 02.03.01-00-0012/17-00 from the European Regional Development Fund.,0,JUN,2019,8,6,10.1093/gigascience/giz065,Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences

Meta-data supplemented with recent observational studies were first analyzed to assess the association between tea consumption and depression risk. The literature reported risk ratios (RR) were 0.69 with 95% confidence intervals of 0.62-0.77. Next, we thoroughly reviewed human trials, mouse models, and in vitro experiments to determine the predominant mechanisms underlying the observed linear relationship between tea consumption and reduced risk of depression. Current theories on the neurobiology of depression were utilized to map tea-mediated mechanisms of antidepressant activity onto an integrated framework of depression pathology. The major nodes within the network framework of depression included hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, inflammation, weakened monoaminergic systems, reduced neurogenesis/neuroplasticity, and poor microbiome diversity affecting the gut-brain axis. We detailed how each node has subsystems within them, including signaling pathways, specific target proteins, or transporters that interface with compounds in tea, mediating their antidepressant effects. A major pathway was found to be the ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, up-regulated by a number of compounds in tea including teasaponin, L-theanine, EGCG and combinations of tea catechins and their metabolites. Black tea theaflavins and EGCG are potent anti-inflammatory agents via down-regulation of NF-kappa B signaling. Multiple compounds in tea are effective modulators of dopaminergic activity and the gut-brain axis. Taken together, our findings show that constituents found in all major tea types, predominantly L-theanine, polyphenols and polyphenol metabolites, are capable of functioning through multiple pathways simultaneously to collectively reduce the risk of depression.","[Rothenberg, Dylan O'Neill; Zhang, Lingyun] South China Agr Univ, Coll Hort Sci, Dept Tea Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National Key Research & Development Program [2018YFD1000601]; Fund of the Technology Innovation of Guizhou Province [{2014}45],"This research was funded by the National Key Research & Development Program, 2018YFD1000601 and Fund of the Technology Innovation of Guizhou Province, {2014}45.",0,JUN,2019,11,6,10.3390/nu11061361,Nutrition & Dietetics

Current interventions are only marginally effective, and identification of associated metabolic pathways can offer new strategies for intervention. Methods: Plasma samples were collected at 9 and 36 months from a subset of the PROVIDE child cohort (n = 130). Targeted metabolomics was performed on bile acids, acylcamitines, amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins. Metabolic associations with linear growth and neurocognitive outcomes at four years were evaluated using correlation and penalized-linear regression analysis as well as conditional random forest modeling. Findings: Different metabolites were associated with growth and neurocognitive outcomes. Improved growth outcomes were associated with higher concentrations of hydroxy-sphingomyelin and essential amino acids and lower levels of acylcamitines and bile acid conjugation. Neurocognitive scores were largely associated with phosphatidylcholine species and early metabolic indicators of inflammation. All metabolites identified explain-45% of growth and neurocognitive variation. Interpretation: Growth outcomes were predominantly associated with metabolites measured early in life (9 months), many of which were biomarkers of insufficient diet, environmental enteric dysfunction, and microbiome disruption. Hydroxy-sphingomyelin was a significant predictor of improved growth. Neurocognitive outcome was predominantly associated with 36 month phosphatidylcholines and inflammatory metabolites, which may serve as important biomarkers of optimal neurodevelopment. The distinct sets of metabolites associated with growth and neurocognition suggest that intervention may require targeted approaches towards distinct metabolic pathways. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Animals occupying subordinate and dominant ranks within these hierarchies differ in their access to food and mating opportunities. Thus, these animals often have different levels of stress, energy reserves and metabolic activity, leading to distinctive behavioural and physiological phenotypes. We hypothesized that phenotypes associated with social rank would affect the gut microbiome, a community of microbes intimately involved in host physiological and metabolic processes. Using male Astatotilapia burtoni, a well-studied species of cichlid, we implemented noninvasive sampling techniques to track microbial variation within individuals occupying different ranks. Our results indicated a lag between the behavioural and physiological changes and microbial community shifts associated with rank change. Given this, subordinate males had higher levels of pathogenic clades and decreased overall community diversity (alpha diversity) while dominant males had higher levels of protective clades and increased alpha diversity. The distributions of several differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were highly correlated with alpha diversity, suggesting that these clades might be involved in structuring the community as a whole. Taken together, our results indicate that behavioural and phenotypic states associated with social rank induce dynamic, population-level shifts in microbiome composition, an effect putatively mediated by the presence of certain bacterial clades. This study is one of the first to evaluate and track the effects of social rank on teleost microbiomes and highlights the importance of integrating microbiome-derived physiological effects into future studies of behaviour.

Methods: We performed amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene V4 variable region to estimate bacterial community characteristics in 259 oral rinse samples, selected based on self-reported smoking and serum cotinine levels, from the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Study. We identified differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by primary and secondhand tobacco exposure, and used ""microbe set enrichment analysis"" to assess shifts in microbial oxygen utilization. Results: Cigarette smoking was associated with depletion of aerobic OTUs (Enrichment Score test statistic ES = -0.75, P = .002) with a minority (29%) of aerobic OTUs enriched in current smokers compared with never smokers. Consistent shifts in the microbiota were observed for current cigarette smokers as for nonsmokers with secondhand exposure as measured by serum cotinine levels. Differential abundance findings were similar in crude and adjusted analyses. Conclusions: Results support a plausible link between tobacco exposure and shifts in the oral microbiome at the population level through three lines of evidence: (1) a shift in microbiota oxygen utilization associated with primary tobacco smoke exposure; (2) consistency of abundance fold changes associated with current smoking and shifts along the gradient of secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmokers; and (3) consistency after adjusting for a priori hypothesized confounders.

This emergent paradigm involves the clinical consideration (where appropriate) of prescriptive dietary modification/improvement, and/or the select judicious use of nutrient-based supplementation to prevent or manage psychiatric disorders. In the last several years, significant links have increasingly been established between dietary quality and mental health (although not all data are supportive). Maternal and early-life nutrition may also affect the mental health outcomes in offspring. In respect to nutraceutical research, like with many recent conventional drug studies, results are fairly mixed across the board, and in many cases there is not emphatic evidence to support the use of nutraceuticals in various psychiatric disorders. This may in part be due to a preponderance of recent studies within the field revealing marked placebo effects. Due to current indicators pointing towards mental disorders having an increasing burden of disease, bold and innovative approaches on a societal level are now required. In light of the widespread use of nutrient supplements by those with and without mental disorders, it is also critical that scientifically rigorous methodologies be brought to bear on the assessment of the efficacy of these supplements, and to determine if, or what dose of, a nutrient supplement is required, for whom, and when, and under what circumstances. More simple studies of additional isolated nutrients are not of great benefit to the field (unless studied in supra-dosage in an individualised, biomarker-guided manner), nor, based on recent data, is the research of shotgun' formulations of nutraceuticals. The next critical step for the field is to design psychiatric interventional studies for both dietary modification and nutraceuticals, based on more of a personalised medicine approach, using biomarkers (e.g. nutrient deficiencies, inflammatory cytokine levels, genomic assessment, microbiome analysis) and a person's dietary patterns and individual macro/micronutrient requirements.","[Sarris, Jerome] Western Sydney Univ, NICM Hlth Res Inst, 158 Hawkesbury Rd, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Sarris, Jerome] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Clin, Dept Psychiat, Professorial Unit, Richmond, Vic, Australia",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1125000],Jerome Sarris is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Fellowship (APP1125000).

Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with IBD experience higher depression rates compared with peers who are well or have other chronic conditions. Mindfulness-based interventions are of particular interest because of their potential to improve both the course of IBD and depression. Methods and analysis This study is a parallel design, single-blind, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in AYAs with IBD and depression. The trial aims to recruit 64 participants who will be randomly allocated to MBCT or treatment as usual. The primary outcome measure is the depression subscale score from the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, stress, post-traumatic growth, IBD-related quality of life, illness knowledge, medication adherence, mindfulness, IBD activity, inflammatory markers, microbiome and brain neuroconnectivity changes. All outcomes other than neuroimaging will be collected at three time points: at baseline, at therapy completion and at 20 weeks. Neuroimaging will be conducted at baseline and at therapy completion. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression modelling will be used to analyse continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. Participants' experiences will be explored through focus groups, and thematic analysis will be used to generate relevant themes.

Despite tremendous efforts to understand its underlying biological mechanisms, MDD pathophysiology remains elusive and pharmacotherapy outcomes are still far from ideal. Low-grade chronic inflammation seems to play a key role in mediating the interface between psychological stress, depressive symptomatology, altered intestinal microbiology, and MDD onset. We review the available pre-clinical and clinical evidence of an involvement of pro-inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis, treatment, and remission of MDD. We focus on caspase 1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and interferon gamma, three inflammatory systems dysregulated in MDD. Treatment strategies aiming at targeting such pathways alone or in combination with classical therapies could prove valuable in MDD. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of immune modulation in MDD and other psychiatric disorders with neuroinflammatory components.","[Inserra, Antonio; Wong, Ma-Li] South Australian Hlth & Med Res Inst, Mind & Brain Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Inserra, Antonio; Wong, Ma-Li] Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med & Publ Hlth, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Inserra, Antonio] Flinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Neurosci, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Alberto Mastronardi, Claudio] Univ Rosario, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Bogota, Colombia; [Alberto Mastronardi, Claudio] Univ Rosario, Neurosci NEUROS Res Grp, Bogota, Colombia; [Rogers, Geraint] South Australia Hlth & Med Res Inst, Infect & Immun Theme, North Terrace, North Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Rogers, Geraint] Flinders Univ S Australia, SAHMRI Microbiome Res Lab, Coll Med & Publ Hlth, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Licinio, Julio] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Coll Med, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Licinio, Julio; Wong, Ma-Li] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",,,4,JUN,2019,56,6,10.1007/s12035-018-1359-3,Neurosciences

Epidemiologic studies have shifted from an exclusive focus on the identification of genetic risk alleles for such disorders to recognizing and understanding the contribution of xenobiotic exposures, infections, and the maternal immune system during the prenatal and early post-natal periods. In this review we discuss the growing literature regarding the effects of maternal brain-reactive antibodies on fetal brain development and their contribution to the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Autoimmune diseases primarily affect women and are more prevalent in mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune disease than women of neurotypically developing children. Moreover, they are four to five times more likely to harbor brain-reactive antibodies than unselected women of childbearing age. Many of these women exhibit no apparent clinical consequence of harboring these antibodies, presumably because the antibodies never access brain tissue. Nevertheless, these maternal brain-reactive antibodies can access the fetal brain, and some may be capable of altering brain development when present during pregnancy. Several animal models have provided evidence that in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies can permanently alter brain anatomy and cause persistent behavioral or cognitive phenotypes. Although this evidence supports a contribution of maternal brain-reactive antibodies to neurodevelopmental disorders, an interplay between antibodies, genetics, and other environmental factors is likely to determine the specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their severity. Additional modulating factors likely also include the microbiome, sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. These interactions may help to explain the sex-bias observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies on this topic provide a unique opportunity to learn how to identify and protect at risk pregnancies while also deciphering critical pathways in neurodevelopment.","[Gata-Garcia, Adriana; Diamond, Betty] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Ctr Autoimmune Muscuioskeletal & Hematopoiet Dis, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Gata-Garcia, Adriana] Donald & Barbara Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Hempstead, NY USA",Nancy Lurie Marks Foundation; Landreth Foundation,The authors received financial support from the Nancy Lurie Marks Foundation and the Landreth Foundation.,0,May-28,2019,10,,10.3389/fimmu.2019.01129,Immunology

Hookworm disease is among the leading causes of iron-deficiency anemia in the developing world and is associated with significant growth stunting and malnutrition. In humans, hookworms appear to impair memory and other forms of cognition, although definitive data are hard to come by. Here we study the impact of a human hookworm parasite, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, on cognition in hamsters in a controlled laboratory setting. We developed tests that measure long-term memory in hamsters. We find that hookworm-infected hamsters were fully capable of detecting a novel object. However, hookworm-infected hamsters were impaired in detecting a displaced object. Defects could be discerned at even at low levels of infection, whereas at higher levels of infection, hamsters were statistically unable to distinguish between displaced and non-displaced objects. These spatial memory deficiencies could not be attributed to defects in infected hamster mobility or to lack of interest. We also found that hookworm infection resulted in reproducible reductions in diversity and changes in specific taxanomic groups in the hamster gut microbiome. These data demonstrate that human hookworm infection in a laboratory mammal results in a specific, rapid, acute, and measurable deficit in spatial memory, and we speculate that gut alterations could play some role in these cognitive deficits. Our findings highlight the importance of hookworm elimination and suggest that finer tuned spatial memory studies be carried out in humans.","[Pan, Samuel C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ward, Doyle V.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Physiol Syst, 368 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Yin, Yunqiang; Hu, Yan; Elfawal, Mostafa A.; Aroian, Raffi V.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, 373 Plantat St,Suite 219, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Clark, Robert E.] Vet Affairs San Diego Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Clark, Robert E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hu, Yan] Worcester State Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01602 USA",National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI056189]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2015-11323]; Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationGates Foundation [OPP1067992]; NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [T32-AI007036],"We are grateful to Thanh Nguyen for parasite maintenance.

However, treatment options, including pharmacotherapies, are limited in number and efficacy. Accumulating evidence suggests that elements of the gut-brain axis, such as neuroendocrine pathways and gut microbiome, are involved in the pathophysiology of AUD and, therefore, may be investigated as potential therapeutic targets. One pathway that has begun to be examined in this regard is the ghrelin system. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data on the relationship between ghrelin and alcohol-related outcomes, with a special focus on the role of the ghrelin system as a treatment target for AUD. Observational studies indicate that endogenous ghrelin levels are positively associated with craving for alcohol, subjective responses to alcohol, and brain activity in response to alcohol cues. Knockout rodent models suggest that deletion of the ghrelin peptide or receptor gene leads to reduction of alcohol intake and other alcohol-related outcomes. Different research groups have found that ghrelin administration increases, while ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) blockade reduces alcohol intake and other alcohol-related outcomes in rodents. Ghrelin administration in heavy-drinking individuals increases alcohol craving and self administration and modulates brain activity in response to alcohol reward anticipation. PF-5190457, a GHS-Rla blocker, has been shown to be safe and tolerable when co-administered with alcohol. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest that this compound may reduce cue-elicited craving for alcohol in heavy-drinking individuals a finding in need of replication. Collectively, the existing literature supports further examination of the ghrelin system as a therapeutic target for AUD. More research is also needed to understand the biobehavioral and molecular mechanisms underlying ghrelin's functions and to examine different interventional approaches to target the ghrelin system for AUD treatment.","[Farokhnia, Mehdi; Faulkner, Monica L.; Piacentino, Dania; Lee, Mary R.; Leggio, Lorenzo] NIAAA, Sect Clin Psychoneuroendocrinol, Div Intramural Clin & Biol Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Farokhnia, Mehdi; Faulkner, Monica L.; Piacentino, Dania; Lee, Mary R.; Leggio, Lorenzo] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Farokhnia, Mehdi; Leggio, Lorenzo] NIH, Ctr Compuls Behav, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Leggio, Lorenzo] NIDA, Medicat Dev Program, Intramural Res Program, NIH, Baltimore, MD USA; [Leggio, Lorenzo] Brown Univ, Ctr Alcohol & Addict Studies, Dept Behav & Social Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [ZIA-AA000218]; NIAAA Division of Intramural Clinical and Biological ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA); NIDA Intramural Research ProgramUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),"This work was supported by NIH intramural funding ZIA-AA000218 (Section on Clinical Psychoneuroendocrinology and Neuropsychopharmacology; PI: Dr. Lorenzo Leggio), jointly supported by the NIAAA Division of Intramural Clinical and Biological Research and the NIDA Intramural Research Program.",4,May-15,2019,204,,10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.02.008,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences"

However, similar effort has not been expended in regard to mental health, a significant public health concern. One in five Americans has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder in the past year, and, in the United States, the number of suicide deaths are similar to the number of deaths due to breast cancer. Increases in mental health disorders in Western societies may be due, in part, to increased systemic inflammation, secondary to decreased exposures to a diverse microbial environment (i.e., the hygiene hypothesis, ""Old Friends"" hypothesis, ""missing microbes"" hypothesis, or biodiversity hypothesis), as well as increased environmental exposures that lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. In this review, we provide an assessment that integrates historical research across disciplines. We offer ten questions that highlight the importance of current lessons learned regarding the built environment and mental health, including a potential role for the microbiome of the built environment to influence mental health.

A healthy diet is essential for proper brain development and maintenance of optimal cognitive functions during adulthood. Furthermore, nutritional components profoundly affect the intestinal community of microbes that may affect gut-brain communication. We adopted a relatively mild stress protocol, social instability stress, which when repeatedly administered to juvenile rats modifies cognitive behaviors and plasticity markers in the brain. We then tested the preventive effect of a prolonged diet enriched with the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid and vitamin A. Our findings highlight the beneficial effects of this enriched diet on cognitive memory impairment induced by social instability stress, as stressed rats fed the enriched diet exhibited performance undistinguishable from that of nonstressed rats on both emotional and reference memory tests. Furthermore, in stressed rats, the decline in brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus and shifts in the microbiota composition were normalized by the enriched diet. The detrimental behavioral and neurochemical effects of adolescent stress, as well as the protective effect of the enriched diet, were maintained throughout adulthood, long after the exposure to the stressful environment was terminated. Taken together, our results strongly suggest a beneficial role of nutritional components in ameliorating stress-related behaviors and associated neurochemical and microbiota changes, opening possible new venues in the field of nutritional neuropsychopharmacology.","[Provensi, Gustavo; Blandina, Patrizio] Univ Firenze, Dept Neurosci Psychol Drug Res & Child Hlth NEURO, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Schmidt, Scheila Daiane; Rani, Barbara; Costa, Alessia; Passani, Maria Beatrice] Univ Firenze, Dept Hlth Sci, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Schmidt, Scheila Daiane; Izquierdo, Ivan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Brain Inst Rio Grande do Sul, Memory Ctr, BR-90619900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Boehme, Marcus; Bastiaanssen, Thomaz F.

Little is known about the potential influence of neighborhood environments on the bacterial and archaea communities that live in and on the human body, henceforth the microbiome. Thus, we examined relationships between the microbiome and features of the urban environment. To do this, we first quantified neighborhood levels of blight (e.g., abandoned buildings) and green remediation (e.g., tree plantings) using parcel data in Detroit, Michigan, and then compared neighborhood status to the composition and diversity of the human postmortem microbiome. The postmortem microbiome served as a surrogate for biological signatures and lifestyles of living neighborhood residents. We observed significant clustering of microbial composition by neighborhood blight, with significantly higher abundances of potential pathogens associated with unhealthy living conditions. We also observed significant clusters between high and low green remediation for the mouth and eye communities only, with high levels of commensals (or nonharmful bacteria) in green remediation neighborhoods. Microbial biodiversity was significantly and positively correlated with green remediation and negatively correlated with blight. Regression models yielded the largest positive effects of green remediation on microbial richness (rectum) and diversity (nose) for women; the largest negative effects of blight were observed for evenness (eyes) among women and richness and diversity (mouth and nose) among men. These results provide evidence of a relationship between the human microbiome and neighborhood conditions, establishing the foundation for novel research opportunities into the effects of green remediation and urban blight on health.","[Pearson, Amber L.; Rzotkiewicz, Amanda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Pearson, Amber L.; Zwickle, Adam] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Pearson, Amber L.] Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Pechal, Jennifer L.; Benbow, M.

It is nowadays well established that the gut microflora's compositional diversity regulates via its genes (the microbiome) the host's health and provides preliminary insights into disease progression and regulation. The microbiome's involvement is evident in immunological and physiological studies that link changes in its biodiversity to its contributions to the host's phenotype but also in neurological investigations, substantiating the aptly named gut-brain axis. The definitive mechanisms of this last bidirectional interaction will be our main focus because it presents researchers with a new conundrum. In this review, we prospect current literature for computational analysis methodologies that accommodate the need for better understanding of the microbiome-gut-brain interactions and neurological disorder onset and progression, through cross-disciplinary systems biology applications. We will present bioinformatics tools used in exploring these synergies that help build and interpret microbial 16S ribosomal RNA data sets, produced by shotgun and high-throughput sequencing of healthy and neurological disorder samples stored in biological databases. These approaches provide alternative means for researchers to form hypotheses to their inquests faster, cheaper and swith precision. The goal of these studies relies on the integration of combined metagenomics and metabolomics assessments. An accurate characterization of the microbiome and its functionality can support new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders, customized for each individual host.","[Dovrolis, Nikolas; Kolios, George] Democritus Univ Thrace, Pharmacol, Alexandroupolis, Greece; [Spyrou, George M.] Cyprus Inst Neurol & Genet, Bioinformat Grp, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Maroulakou, Ioanna] Democritus Univ Thrace, Genet, Alexandroupolis, Greece",European Commission Research Executive Agency (REA) Grant BIORISE [669026],"G.M.S. holds the Bioinformatics ERA Chair position funded by the European Commission Research Executive Agency (REA) Grant BIORISE (grant number 669026), under the Spreading Excellence, Widening Participation, Science with and for Society Framework.",6,MAY,2019,20,3,10.1093/bib/bbx154,Biochemical Research Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology

However, recent epidemiological and experimental data suggest that dysregulated maternal immune activation (MIA) can impede normal brain maturation and promote the development of autism-related phenotypes. Indeed, our studies and work by others demonstrate that offspring born to pregnant animals that were exposed to immune activators develop many of the defining behavioral features of ASD, including abnormalities in social preference, communicative impairments, and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. Although mounting evidence implicates key roles for hyperactive gestational inflammatory responses in neurodevelopmental disorders, the specific immune pathways that provoke autism-related phenotypes remain poorly described. The microbiome is recognized as a key modulator of immune responses, and emerging studies suggest that microbiota composition is a pivotal regulator of central nervous system function and disease. There has been growing speculation that changes in human microflora diversity contribute at some level to the recent rise in autism incidence. This has largely stemmed from reports of dysbiosis and gastrointestinal inflammation in autistic individuals. Given these clinical findings and the well-described role of the microbiome in calibrating the immune system, our group and others have recently become interested in investigating how changes in microbiota landscape influence neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight emerging data describing roles for microbiota in the development of autism-related behavioral abnormalities. These recent findings identify the immune system as a link between gut microbiota and the brain in neurodevelopmental disorders, and suggest that targeting the microbiome and maternal immune responses during gestation may offer strategies to limit autism development in at-risk pregnancies.","[Paysour, Matt J.; Bolte, Ashley C.; Lukens, John R.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Brain Immunol & Glia BIG, Dept Neurosci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Bolte, Ashley C.; Lukens, John R.] Univ Virginia, Med Scientist Training Program, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Lukens, John R.] Univ Virginia, Grad Program Neurosci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA",Hartwell Foundation; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) [515305]; University of Virginia Supporting Transformative Autism Research (STAR) Initiative; University of Virginia Brain Institute; Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Virginia [5T32GM007267-38],"The authors apologize to authors whose work could not be referenced in this review due to space limitations.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.","[Fitzpatrick, Connor R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fitzpatrick, Connor R.; Mustafa, Zainab; Viliunas, Joani] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",Sigma Xi,"Sigma Xi, Grant/Award Number: GIAR",0,MAY,2019,32,5,10.1111/jeb.13426,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity

Examples include substance abuse, medical costs, medical care utilization, biomarkers (e.g., CD4 cell counts, coronary artery calcium scores), single cell gene expression rates, and (relative) abundance of microbiome. Such data are often characterized by the presence of a large portion of zero values and positive continuous values that are skewed to the right and heteroscedastic. Both of these features suggest that no simple parametric distribution may be suitable for modeling such type of outcomes. In this paper, we review statistical methods for analyzing zero-inflated nonnegative outcome data. We will start with the cross-sectional setting, discussing ways to separate zero and positive values and introducing flexible models to characterize right skewness and heteroscedasticity in the positive values. We will then present models of correlated zero-inflated nonnegative continuous data, using random effects to tackle the correlation on repeated measures from the same subject and that across different parts of the model. We will also discuss expansion to related topics, for example, zero-inflated count and survival data, nonlinear covariate effects, and joint models of longitudinal zero-inflated nonnegative continuous data and survival. Finally, we will present applications to three real datasets (i.e., microbiome, medical costs, and alcohol drinking) to illustrate these methods.

At the same time, it is clear that there is an intimate connection between psychiatry and gastrointestinal health. Here, we have discussed various comorbid conditions associated with bipolar disorders such as inflammation, irritable bowel disease and antibiotic induced mania with importance to demonstrate possible involvement of the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota-targeted preclinical and clinical interventions have demonstrated enhancement in various psychological conditions. Further in this review, we explore links between bipolar disorder, inflammation and gut microbiome with a focus on dietary, pro- and pre-biotic interventions as potential adjuvant therapies for use in the management of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder.","[Gondalia, Shakuntla; Parkinson, Lisa; Stough, Con; Scholey, Andrew] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Human Psychopharmacol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",,,1,MAY,2019,236,5,10.1007/s00213-019-05248-6,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry

Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. have been implicated in psychological health, such as depression, through various pathways (e.g. inflammation). Research needs a better understanding of direct and indirect effects through examination of psychological factors that make people susceptible to, or offer protection against, depression.ObjectiveThis study investigated the relationships between gut microbiota, inflammation and psychological risk and resilience factors for depression.MethodsForty participants (13 m/27 f) recruited from the general population completed self-report questionnaires for depression, self-judgement, over-identification and affective and cognitive empathy. Faecal and blood samples were taken to assay microbiota (Bifidobacterium; Lactobacillus spp.) and pro-inflammatory molecules (C-reactive protein, CRP and interleukin-6, IL-6), respectively.ResultsHierarchical regression analyses (controlling for sex, age and the shared variance of risk and resilience factors) showed that (i) cognitive depression was significantly predicted by negative self-judgement and reduced cognitive empathy; (ii) abundance of Lactobacillus spp. was directly related to positive self-judgement but only indirectly to cognitive depression and lower affective empathy (both through self-judgement); and (iii) CRP was the strongest predictor of reduced cognitive empathy, with suppression effects seen for age (negative) and IL-6 (positive) after controlling for CRP.ConclusionsFindings suggest that lactobacilli and inflammation may be differentially associated with mood disorder via brain mechanisms underpinning self-judgement and cognitive empathy, respectively. Further trials investigating interventions to increase Lactobacillus spp. in depression would benefit from direct measures of self-judgement and affective empathic distress, whilst those that aim to reduce inflammation should investigate cognitive empathy.","[Heym, N.; Heasman, B.

In turn, the gut microbiota (GMB) has been implicated in the kinetics of many of these analytes. Unfortunately, research into the possible relevance of GMB-mediated SPMs to neuropsychiatry continues to be limited byheterogeneous study design, numerous sources of variance and technical challenges. Some SPMs have multiple structural isomers and most have conjugates. Without specialized approaches, SPMs can be incorrectly assigned or inaccurately quantified. In addition, SPM levels can be affected by dietary polyphenol or protein consumption and by various medications and diseases. Nonetheless, heterotypical excretion of various SPMs in association with schizophrenia or autism continues to be reported in independent samples. Recent studies in human cerebrospinal fluiddemonstrate the presence of many SPMs A large number of these arebioactive in experimental models. Whether such mechanisms are relevant to the human brain in health or diseaseis not known.

These are all core features frequently altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Current treatment recommendations for AN support the use of high-calorie diets as an essential part of nutritional rehabilitation, commonly achieved by elevating the fat content of the diet. However, in contrast to this approach, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the importance of balanced, high-fibre diets on the gut microbiome. Studies have demonstrated profound differences in the microbial composition of underweight people with AN and those of normal- or overweight individuals. Specific alterations vary widely between studies. It is thus far unclear to what extent the observed differences are brought on by iatrogenic effects of nutritional rehabilitation or the disorder itself. To date, only two studies have investigated the changes in the intestinal microbiota during nutritional rehabilitation and corresponding weight restoration. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome of AN patients was different to healthy controls both prior and following nutritional rehabilitation, though it is noted that these states were associated with lower and higher nutritional intakes, respectively. There is a clear need for further investigation regarding the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on the gut microbiome. Such research would provide insights into the potential role of gut microbiome in modulating the pathophysiology of AN and inform future treatment strategies.","[Ruusunen, Anu; Rocks, Tetyana; Jacka, Felice; Loughman, Amy] Deakin Univ, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Sch Med, Food & Mood Ctr, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Ruusunen, Anu] Kuopio Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kuopio, Finland; [Ruusunen, Anu] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Publ Hlth & Clin Nutr, Kuopio, Finland; [Jacka, Felice] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice] Black Dog Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Postdoctoral Fellowship from Faculty of Health, Deakin University; Wilson Foundation; Fernwood Foundation","AR has been funded by Postdoctoral Fellowship from Faculty of Health, Deakin University.

Moreover, it has been reported that perturbations in gut microbe diversity and richness influence serotonergic, GABAergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Among these, dopamine is regarded as a main regulator of cognitive functions such as decision making, attention, memory, motivation, and reward. In this work, we will highlight findings that link alterations in intestinal microbiota and dopaminergic neurotransmission, with a particular emphasis on the mesocorticolimbic circuit, which is involved in reward to natural reinforcers, as well as abuse substances. For this, we reviewed evidence from studies carried out on germ-free animals, or in rodents subjected to intestinal dysbiosis using antibiotics, and also through the use of probiotics. All this evidence strongly supports that the microbiota-gut-brain axis is key to the physiopathology of several neuropsychiatric disorders involving those where dopaminergic neurotransmission is compromised. In addition, the gut microbiota appears as a key player when it comes to proposing novel strategies to the treatment of these psychiatric conditions.","[Gonzalez-Arancibia, Camila; Urrutia-Pinones, Jocelyn; Illanes-Gonzalez, Javiera; Julio-Pieper, Marcela; Bravo, Javier A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Lab Quim Biol & Bioquim Sistemas, Grp NeuroGastroBioquim, Inst Quim,Fac Ciencias, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Region De Valpa, Chile; [Gonzalez-Arancibia, Camila; Martinez-Pinto, Jonathan; Sotomayor-Zarate, Ramon] Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Neurobiol & Fisiopatol Integrat, Lab Neuroquim & Neurofarmacol, Inst Fisiol,Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez-Arancibia, Camila; Urrutia-Pinones, Jocelyn; Illanes-Gonzalez, Javiera] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Menc Neurociencia, Valparaiso, Chile","FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140776, 1190729, 1160398, 1181019]; IDRC; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)","This work was supported by FONDECYT Grants #1140776 and #1190729 to J.A.B, #1160398 to R.S-Z and #1181019 to M.J-P.

Infancy likely represents a critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had provided fecal samples for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity were generated and tested for associations with measures of functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was significantly associated with functional connectivity between the amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity also related to cognitive outcomes at 2years of age, suggesting a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and cognitive outcomes during infancy.

We assessed herb use among women from the five most prevalent ethnic groups, and if herb use is associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Setting Participants were recruited at a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic and a family planning clinic (FP) in Paramaribo, Suriname. Participants 1040 women were included subsequently, comprising the following ethnic groups: Creole (26.7%), Hindustani (24.6%), Javanese (15.7%), Maroon (13.3%) and mixed descent (19.7%). Methods Nurses collected a questionnaire and vaginal swabs for nucleic acid amplification C. trachomatis testing. Primary outcomes Determinants of vaginal herb use and C. trachomatis infection via univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results Herb use was most common among Maroon (68.8%) and Creole women (25.2%). In multivariable analysis including only Maroon and Creole women, determinants significantly associated with vaginal herb use were (OR; 95% CI): Maroon ethnic descent (5.33; 3.26 to 8.71 vs Creole), recruitment at the STI clinic (2.04; 1.24 to 3.36 vs FP), lower education levels (3.80; 1.68 to 8.57 lower vs higher, and 2.02; 0.90 to 4.51 middle vs higher). Lower age and recruitment at the STI clinic were associated with C. trachomatis infection, but not vaginal herb use. Conclusion In Suriname, vaginal herb use is common among Maroon and Creole women. Education, ethnic group and recruitment site were determinants for herb use. Vaginal herb use was not a determinant of C. trachomatis infection. Future research should focus on the effect of herb use on the vaginal microbiome and mucosal barrier.","[Van der Helm, Jannie J.; van der Loeff, Maarten Franciscus Schim; de Vries, Esther; van der Veer, Charlotte; de Vries, Henry J.

The manifestation of numerous pathologies in humans is considered to be intrinsically associated with microbial dysbiosis in the gut (i.e. a poorly balanced microbiota). Such adverse health conditions include obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular issues, neurological disorders, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and rheumatoid arthritis. Endosymbiotic events at the single cell level took place billions of years ago, eventually leading to eukaryotes, photosynthesis, and multicellularity. Macroalgae (seaweeds) were amongst the first organisms to develop these characteristics. Microbes and macroalgae interacted in a pattern of co-evolution, a process that applies to most, if not all living organisms. It is recognized that the normal human microbiome consists of over a trillion microorganisms, including about 2 000 commensal bacterial species typically stationed in the gut. Many of these live in the colon, where they function in the digestion of foods, releasing bio-available nutrients, bioactive molecules, and various metabolites. They mediate communication signals between the gut and the brain, and promote the normal development of immune function, metabolic activities, behaviour, and neurological stability. As very early humans foraged for food, some would have benefitted from coastal diets, rich in seaweeds and associated microbes. Such diets would have consistently provided all the nutrients essential for survival and growth, and as such, could have conveyed competitive advantages and contributed to enhanced cognitive sophistication. This mini-review article highlights studies regarding the health benefits of dietary fibres and the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Insights are offered regarding the positive effects the inclusion of macroalgae into the standard, Western diet can deliver in terms of providing appropriate fodder for those microbial populations deemed beneficial to human health and wellness.","[Cornish, M.

In addition, co-morbidities such as gastro-intestinal problems have frequently been reported. Mutations and deletion of proteins of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains (SHANK) gene-family were identified in patients with ASD, and Shank knock-out mouse models display autism-like phenotypes. SHANK3 proteins are not only expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show expression in gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and report a significantly different GI morphology in Shank3 knock-out (KO) mice. Further, we detected a significantly altered microbiota composition measured in feces of Shank3 KO mice that may contribute to inflammatory responses affecting brain development. In line with this, we found higher E. coli lipopolysaccharide levels in liver samples of Shank3 KO mice, and detected an increase in Interleukin-6 and activated astrocytes in Shank3 KO mice. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 plays a specific role in the GI tract that may contribute to the ASD phenotype by extracerebral mechanisms.","[Sauer, Ann Katrin; Grabrucker, Andreas M.] Univ Limerick, Dept Biol Sci, Cellular Neurobiol & Neuronanotechnol Lab, Limerick V94PH61, Ireland; [Bockmann, Juergen; Boeckers, Tobias M.] Ulm Univ, Inst Anat & Cell Biol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Steinestel, Konrad] Muenster Univ, Med Ctr, Gerhard Domagk Inst Pathol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Grabrucker, Andreas M.] Univ Limerick, HRI, Limerick V94PH61, Ireland; [Grabrucker, Andreas M.] Univ Limerick, Bernal Inst, Limerick V94PH61, Ireland","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB1149]; Else Kroner-Fresenius Stiftung; Helmholtz Society (DZNE, Ulm Site); Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking (AIMS-2-Trials) from the European Union [777394]; EFPIA companies; Else Kroner-Fresenius Stiftung [214_A251]","T.M.B. has received support from the DFG (SFB1149, A02), the Else Kroner-Fresenius Stiftung, the Helmholtz Society (DZNE, Ulm Site), and the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking (AIMS-2-Trials) under grant agreement no777394, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union and EFPIA companies' in kind contribution.

The complex interaction of multiple mechanisms, underlying these disorders, still needs further elucidation. Increased activation of components of the immune system may be involved, including alterations in intestinal permeability and gut microbiome. Probiotics, defined as living microorganisms conferring health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts, seem to have supportive therapeutic effect in psychiatric disorders. The authors in this review provide an overview of this emerging research field and summarize both the publicated microbiome studies in SCZ and bipolar disorder and the current clinical research using probiotic supplementation in patients diagnosed with these disorders. Recent findings The current data indicate that there are differences in the microbiome in SCZ and bipolar disorder patients as compared with healthy controls. Part of these differences may be induced by medication use, others by smoking and other lifestyle factors. Correlations between microbiome quantification and symptom severity have been observed in cross-sectional studies, but unfortunately, no replicated findings so far. Probiotic supplementation was shown not only to alleviate gastrointestinal complaints but also reduce symptom severity, rehospitalization rates and cognitive improvement. Replication of improvement of cognition is needed. Summary Differences in microbiome have been shown in both SCZ and bipolar disorder in comparison to healthy controls.

Urbanization holds great public health implications spanning various environmental, lifestyle behavioural, economic and social domains. Underlying risk factors for mood disorders are heterogeneous but the psychiatric literature has extended beyond individual-level risk, to account for population-level environment and social-related precursors to mental ill health. This review summarizes recent studies published since 2017 examining the impact of urbanization and associated environmental, social and lifestyle risks for mood disorders, specifically depression. Recent findings All identified studies examined depression or subclinical mood-related symptomatology. Recent evidence suggests individuals residing in urban areas experience increased risk of depression. Mechanistic pathways include increased exposure to noise, light and air pollution, poor quality housing, reduced diet quality, physical inactivity, economic strain and diminished social networks. The role of the gut microbiome in the development of mood disorders represents a novel research domain expected to hold potential for the psychiatric and environmental field. Further research is needed to extrapolate the relationship between increased sedentary lifestyles and technology use and depression in urban societies. Summary Recent evidence highlights the complexity and reciprocity of underlying driving factors in the relationship between urbanization and mood disorders. Future epidemiological research should continue to untangle such complexity. There was a dearth of evidence relating to urbanization and mood disorders other than depression. Future research should identify the unique experiences of vulnerable subgroups who experience disproportionate increased risk of adverse health experiences associated with urbanization.","[Hoare, Erin; Jacka, Felice] Deakin Univ, Food & Mood Ctr, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Deakin Univ, IMPACT SRC, Sch Med, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Natl Ctr Excellence Youth Mental Hlth, Orygen, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Youth Mental Hlth, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Dept Psychiat, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Australian Rotary Health Royce Abbey Postdoctoral Fellowship; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1108125]; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Senior Principal Research FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1059660, APP1156072]",E.H. is supported by an Australian Rotary Health Royce Abbey Postdoctoral Fellowship.

These scientific discoveries can be organized into distinctive time periods: 1900-1979, which focused on exercise-induced changes in basic immune cell counts and function; 1980-1989, during which seminal papers were published with evidence that heavy exertion was associated with transient immune dysfunction, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, and increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections; 1990-2009, when additional focus areas were added to the field of exercise immunology including the interactive effect of nutrition, effects on the aging immune system, and inflammatory cytokines; and 2010 to the present, when technological advances in mass spectrometry allowed system biology approaches (i.e., metabolomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and microbiome characterization) to be applied to exercise immunology studies. The future of exercise immunology will take advantage of these technologies to provide new insights on the interactions between exercise, nutrition, and immune function, with application down to the personalized level.

Pasteurized donor human milk has been used for decades in neonatal intensive care units, but its use is relatively new in the well- baby population. Study Design and Methods: Focus groups of maternal child nurses were conducted to explore this topic. Results: Six focus groups that included a total 20 nurses were held. Four themes were identifi ed: 1) nurses presumed safety of PDHM but lacked knowledge, 2) nurses' role as patient- family advocate, 3) nurses' logistical concerns about implementation of PDHM, and 4) nurses lacked clarity on formal milk sharing versus PDHM. Clinical Implications: As the use of PDHM increases for well babies, nurses will need more education about PDHM, its safety profi le, its use in breastfeeding support and protection of the infant microbiome, and how PDHM differs from informal milk sharing. Nurses play an important role in helping parents weigh risks and benefi ts of using PDHM or formula when supplementation is needed during the hospital stay. It is important that nurses feel confi dent in their own knowledge and ability to address parental concerns so they can advocate for their patients and support parental decision- making.","[Ferrarello, Debi] Penn Med Penn Hosp, Program Dev, Womens Hlth Serv Line, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ferrarello, Debi] Penn Med Penn Hosp, Parent Educ & Lactat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Froh, Elizabeth B.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Pediat Nursing Res & Evidence Based Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hinson, Tyonne D.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Nursing Divers Initiat, Boston, MA USA; [Spatz, Diane L.] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Perinatal Nursing, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Spatz, Diane L.] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Nutr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Spatz, Diane L.] CHOP, Lactat Program, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Spatz, Diane L.] CHOPs Mothers Milk Bank, Philadelphia, PA USA",,,1,MAY-JUN,2019,44,3,10.1097/NMC.0000000000000525,Nursing

The ways in which affiliation may affect the risk of infectious agent transmission remain unclear. Moreover, studies linking variation in affiliative interactions to infectious agent incidence/diversity have speculated that disease transmission may have occurred, rather than revealing that transmission did occur. We address these gaps using the phylogenetics of commensal gut Escherichia coli to determine whether affiliative grooming and huddling social networks mediated microbial transmission among rhesus macaques. We collected behavioural and microbial data from adult macaques across a 12-week period that was split into two 6-week phases to better detect dyadic transmission. We reconstructed undirected social networks from affiliative interactions and reconstructed microbial transmission networks from the pairwise phylogenetic similarity of E. coli pulsotypes from macaques within and across adjacent sampling events. Macaque E. coli pulsotypes were more phylogenetically similar to each other than to environmental isolates, which established a premise for socially mediated transmission. Dyadic grooming and huddling frequencies strongly influenced the likelihood of E. coli transmission during the second data collection phase, but not the first. Macaques that were more central/well connected in both their grooming and huddling networks were also more central in the E. coli transmission networks. Our results confirmed that affiliative grooming and huddling behaviours mediate the transmission of gut microbes among rhesus macaques, particularly among females and high-ranking individuals. The detectability of socially mediated E. coli transmission maybe partially masked by environmental acquisition in males, or by high frequencies of interactions in captivity. Predicting the potential transmission pathways of gastrointestinal parasites and pathogens, our findings add to current knowledge of the coevolutionary relationships between affiliative behaviour and health and may be used to identify 'superspreader' individuals as potential targets for disease control strategies.

We explored associations between ASD and breastfeeding initiation (yes/no) and duration (months categorized in tertiles) in the Study to Explore Early Development, a community-based case-control study in six sites in the Unites States. We adjusted for various child and mother demographic and pregnancy factors. Breastfeeding initiation was reported in 85.7% of mothers of children with ASD and 90.6% of mothers of controls. After adjustment, we found no significant difference in breastfeeding initiation (adjusted odds-ratio [aOR]: 0.88 and 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-1.28). However, mothers of children with ASD were less likely to report duration of breastfeeding in the high (>= 12 months) versus low tertile (<6 months) (aOR and 95% CI: 0.61 [0.45-0.84]) or the middle (6-<12 months) versus low tertile (0.72: 0.54-0.98). The association of ASD and breastfeeding duration was slightly attenuated when the presence of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) in the mother was accounted for, but still remained for the highest tertile. This association does not appear to be totally explained by maternal BAP. We were unable to distinguish whether the difference in duration was due to difficulties breastfeeding children who later develop ASD, other factors not adjusted in our study, or greater ASD risk resulting from shorter breastfeeding duration. Longitudinal studies that compare reasons why mothers stop breastfeeding between ASD and controls and establish a temporal relation between ASD and breastfeeding are needed. Future studies should also evaluate interactions between ASD risk genes and breastfeeding. Autism Research 2019, 12: 816-829. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary In this study, we compared breastfeeding practices between mothers of children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found that the percentage of mothers who started breastfeeding was similar between the two groups, but mothers of children with ASD breastfed for a shorter amount of time compared to mothers of children without ASD. Future studies are needed to evaluate the reasons why the duration of breastfeeding was shorter for mothers of children with ASD compared to those without ASD.","[Soke, Gnakub N.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Sci Educ & Profess Dev, Epidem Intelligence Serv, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Soke, Gnakub N.; Maenner, Matthew; Schieve, Laura A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Birth Defects & Dev Disabil, 4770 Buford Hwy,MS E86, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Windham, Gayle] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Environm Hlth Invest Branch, Richmond, CA USA; [Moody, Eric] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA; [Kaczaniuk, Jamie] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [DiGuiseppi, Carolyn] Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA","Centers for Disease Control and PreventionUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA [U10DD000180, U10DD000181, U10DD000182, U10DD000183, U10DD000184, U10DD000498]","SEED I was funded by six cooperative agreements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000180, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000181, Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (CA); Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000182, University of Pennsylvania; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000183, Johns Hopkins University; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000184, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000498, Michigan State University.",0,MAY,2019,12,5,10.1002/aur.2091,"Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Developmental"

We find evidence of moderated mediation where individuals exposed to an article about microbiome research and therapies with explicit references to disgusting stimuli perceived greater risk through a mediating variable, elicited disgust. This indirect effect is moderated by the focus of the article; those who viewed a human-focused article experienced greater disgust and reported greater perceived risks.

The purpose of this study is to examine the durability of these diet-induced microstructural alterations. We implemented a crossover experimental design where post-weaned male rats were assigned to one of four experimental diets. Following the administration of experimental diets and again following crossover and resumption of a normal diet, brains were imaged ex-vivo with diffusion tensor imaging. Following standard image preprocessing, tract-based spatial statistics and region-of-interest measurements were then calculated for all diffusion tensor indices. Voxel-wise differences in FA were identified in the high fat diet group when compared to animals receiving a control diet. Following crossover, there were new voxel-wise changes in both FA and TR that do not correspond to the regions previously identified. Animals crossed over from the high fiber diet demonstrate widespread and global changes in the diffusion tensor that stand in stark contrast to the minimal changes identified before crossover. While no significant differences between any of the diffusion metrics were identified in the high protein group before crossover, statistically significant decreased RD values were observed following resumption of a normal diet. Diet-induced changes in neural microstructure are durable changes that are unrecoverable following the resumption of a normal diet. We further show that in certain experimental diets, resumption of a normal diet can lead to further marked and unanticipated changes in white matter microstructure.","[Torres-Velazquez, Maribel; Yu, John-Paul J.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Sawin, Emily A.; Anderson, Jacqueline M.; Yu, John-Paul J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Radiol, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Yu, John-Paul J.] Univ Wisconsin, Neurosci Training Program, Wisconsin Inst Med Res, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Yu, John-Paul J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Madison, WI 53705 USA","Department of Radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Grant; Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program, through the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR002373]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UL1TR000427, TL1TR000429]; University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center Support Grant [P30CA014520]","J-P.J.Y was supported by Department of Radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Grant.

This shows that, probably the beneficial gut bacteria or probiotics function mechanistically as delivery vehicles for neuroactive compounds. Thus, a psychobiotic is a live organism, when ingested in adequate amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness.

Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted.

CHEESMAN; IN-VITRO REGENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GENOME SEQUENCE; CROP; MUSACEAE; WILD; BANANA; FOOD,"Background Enset (Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae) is an African crop that currently provides the staple food for approx. 20 million Ethiopians. Whilst wild enset grows over much of East and Southern Africa and the genus extends across Asia to China, it has only ever been domesticated in the Ethiopian Highlands. Here, smallholder farmers cultivate hundreds of landraces across diverse climatic and agroecological systems. Scope Enset has several important food security traits. It grows over a relatively wide range of conditions, is somewhat drought-tolerant, and can be harvested at any time of the year, over several years. It provides an important dietary starch source, as well as fibres, medicines, animal fodder, roofing and packaging. It stabilizes soils and microclimates and has significant cultural importance. In contrast to the other cultivated species in the family Musaceae (banana), enset has received relatively little research attention. Here, we review and critically evaluate existing research, outline available genomic and germplasm resources, aspects of pathology, and explore avenues for crop development. Conclusion Enset is an underexploited starch crop with significant potential in Ethiopia and beyond. Research is lacking in several key areas: empirical studies on the efficacy of current agronomic practices, the genetic diversity of landraces, approaches to systematic breeding, characterization of existing and emerging diseases, adaptability to new ranges and land-use change, the projected impact of climate change, conservation of crop wild relatives, by-products or co-products or non-starch uses, and the enset microbiome. We also highlight the limited availability of enset germplasm in living collections and seedbanks, and the lack of knowledge of reproductive and germination biology needed to underpin future breeding. By reviewing the current state of the art in enset research and identifying gaps and opportunities, we hope to catalyse the development and sustainable exploitation of this neglected starch crop.","[Borrell, James S.; Davis, Aaron P.; Willis, Kathy; Demissew, Sebsebe; Wilkin, Paul] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Biswas, Manosh K.; Goodwin, Mark; Schwarzacher, Trude; Heslop-Harrison, J.

The effect of tobacco is even more contundent in people with mental illness and, in general, cigarette smoking addiction is influenced by genetic factors. The opioid system is involved in the mesolimbic reward system, which is of great importance in addictive behaviors, such as smoking and is influenced by genes such as the OPRM1. The aim of this study was to evaluate if selecting a comparison group that include light smokers versus people that never smoked impacts the results of genetic association studies. In addition, to evaluate the genetic association in different groups of smokers by analyzing independent covariates such as mental illness and clinical dental data. All subjects were participants of the Dental Registry and DNA Repository project. Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan chemistry for two markers in OPRM1 (rs553202 and rs7755635). Logistic regression analyses were performed as implemented in PLINK. The established value for alpha was 5%, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by the chi-square test with one degree of freedom for each marker. 1,897 patients were included, which were allocated to eight distinct groups, according to the frequency and quantity of cigarettes smoked and mental illness status. There was no significant association between the two markers in OPRM1 and smoking. When mental illness and dental clinical data (tooth loss, dental caries, and periodontitis) were used as covariates, there were associations between heavy smoking and OPRM1, when non-smokers were used as comparison. We did not have diet or microbiome data to consider for these dental analyses and suggest that these kinds of data should be always incorporated in the future. Significant results were found only when the covariables mental illness and oral clinical data were added to the analysis.","[Henn, Indiara W.; Alanis, Luciana R.

Modifying the gut microbiome is a potential route to improve gastrointestinal (GI) and behavioral symptoms in children with ASD, and fecal microbiota transplant could transform the dysbiotic gut microbiome toward a healthy one by delivering a large number of commensal microbes from a healthy donor. We previously performed an open-label trial of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) that combined antibiotics, a bowel cleanse, a stomach-acid suppressant, and fecal microbiota transplant, and observed significant improvements in GI symptoms, autism-related symptoms, and gut microbiota. Here, we report on a follow-up with the same 18 participants two years after treatment was completed. Notably, most improvements in GI symptoms were maintained, and autism-related symptoms improved even more after the end of treatment. Important changes in gut microbiota at the end of treatment remained at follow-up, including significant increases in bacterial diversity and relative abundances of Bifidobacteria and Prevotella. Our observations demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of MTT as a potential therapy to treat children with ASD who have GI problems, and warrant a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the future.","[Kang, Dae-Wook; Maldonado, Juan; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Swette Ctr Environm Biotechnol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kang, Dae-Wook; Maldonado, Juan; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Ctr Fundamental & Appl Microbi, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Adams, James B.; Coleman, Devon M.; Pollard, Elena L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [McDonough-Means, Sharon] Integrat Dev Pediat, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA; [Caporaso, J.

Cumulative evidence has revealed that metabolic dysfunctions frequently occur in patients receiving antipsychotics, especially second-generation antipsychotics, and these effects may decrease patient compliance and increase health costs. Metformin is an effective pharmaceutical adjuvant for ameliorating antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction (AIMD) in clinical practice. However, the mechanism of the effects of metformin on AIMD remains unclear. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system and has been associated with many pathological and physiological conditions, such as those related to metabolism. Antipsychotics interact with and have affinity for dopamine receptors and other receptors in the brain, and treatment with these antipsychotics has been shown to influence gut microbiota metabolism and composition, as observed in both animal and human studies. Metformin exerts an antidiabetic effect that is correlated with activation of AMP-kinase in the hypothalamus, and metformin also influences gut flora. Therefore, the gut-brain axis may play a role in the effect of metformin on AIMD. Since no direct evidence is available, this perspective may provide a direction for further research.","[Luo, Chao; Wang, Xu; Huang, Hanxue; Mao, Xiaoyuan; Zhou, Honghao; Liu, Zhaoqian] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Chao; Wang, Xu; Huang, Hanxue; Mao, Xiaoyuan; Zhou, Honghao; Liu, Zhaoqian] Cent S Univ, Hunan Key Lab Pharmacogenet, Inst Clin Pharmacol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Chao] Cent S Univ, Sch Life Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Honghao; Liu, Zhaoqian] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Natl Clin Res Ctr Geriatr Disorders, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1306900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81573508]; Open Foundation of Innovative Platform in Colleges and University of Hunan Province of China [[2015]54]; Clinical Research Fund of Peking University Unamed-Central South University Xiangya Hospital [xywm2015I16],"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1306900), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81573508), Open Foundation of Innovative Platform in Colleges and University of Hunan Province of China ([2015]54), and Clinical Research Fund of Peking University Unamed-Central South University Xiangya Hospital (xywm2015I16).",0,Apr-09,2019,10,,10.3389/fphar.2019.00371,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Mother-infant interaction and maternal responsiveness and sensitivity are a hypothesized mechanism by which perinatal depression effects child development, and increasing research in the microbiota-gut-brain axis may provide a new avenue of investigation. There is limited efficacy for treatment of perinatal depression for improving the mother-infant relationship and child outcomes. The maternal microbiota may be the basis of child outcomes through foetal programming and sharing of microbes between mother and infant. There is evidence that less diversity of the intestinal microbial community is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety in mothers and offspring. Assessing the maternal and child's microbial communities may be an important missing component in mother-infant attachment-based therapies during treatment of perinatal depression. Probiotics and prebiotics require further research as additions to mother-infant interventions. Further research may enable identification of bacterial genes that indicate specific pathways that could be targeted to improve outcomes for mother and child.","[Sanders, Amanda; Rackers, Hannah; Kimmel, Mary] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Campus Box 7160, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,0,Apr-03,2019,31,3,10.1080/09540261.2018.1548431,Psychiatry

We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration. Recent findings Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Summary Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted.","[Neill, Sarah; Dean, Nathan] Intermt Med Ctr, Sect Pulm & Crit Care Med, Murray, KY USA; [Neill, Sarah; Dean, Nathan] Univ Utah Hlth, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, 26N 1900 E,701 Wintrobe, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA",,,0,APR,2019,32,2,10.1097/QCO.0000000000000524,Infectious Diseases

Probiotics have the potential to healthfully modulate the gut microbiome. Prebiotics could also be effective by stimulation of growth of some bacterial species in the gut microbiota. Objective: The aim of this double blind clinical trial, was to compare the effect of supplementation with the probiotic and prebiotic on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score as a primary outcome as well as the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and tryptophan/branch chain amino acids (BCAAs) ratio as secondary outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: One hundred and ten depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive the probiotic (Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum), prebiotic (galactooligosaccharide) or placebo for 8 weeks. Serum tryptophan and BCAAs were measured by HPLC, and kynurenine by ELISA kit. Dietary intake and physical activity of the participants were recorded at baseline. Results: A total of 81 subjects (aged 36.5 +/- 8.03 y; mean (95% CI), 2.27 (1.76-2.93) y of depression duration) completed the trial (28 in the probiotic group, 27 in the prebiotic group, and 26 in the placebo group). From baseline to 8 weeks, probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in BDI score (17.39-9.1) compared to the placebo (18.18-15.55) and prebiotic (19.72-14.14) supplementation (p = 0.042). Inter-group comparison indicated no significant differences among the groups in terms of serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and tryptophan/BCAAs ratio. However, the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio decreased significantly in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group after adjusting for serum isoleucine (p = 0.048). In addition, the tryptophan/isoleucine ratio increased significantly in the probiotic group when compared to the placebo group (p = 0.023). Conclusion: Overall, 8 weeks of probiotic supplements to subjects with MDD resulted in an improvement in BDI score compared with placebo whereas no significant effect of prebiotic supplementation was seen.

Any damage to the neuronal system causes serious impairment to the host as it may lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autism and epilepsy. The physical and mental health of an individual is associated with food habits and brain health. The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that initiates a response to different types of stress. However, recent findings have revealed that food play a major role in regulating stress and mental health. In this regard, probiotics are beneficial microbes that are claimed to offer health benefits when consumed in adequate quantities. Probiotics alter the gut microbial composition in a positive way. Several in vitro, in vivo and pre-clinical studies have been conducted to determine the effects of probiotics or probiotic based food supplementation on the cognitive function of model system and human volunteers. Most of the studies suggest that the consumption of probiotic formulations improves cognitive function, stress management, and decision-making. This paper reviews recent findings regarding the influence of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function, especially in human subjects.

Individual prenatal care of women with obesity includes early testing for diabetes, counseling on epigenetic diets, advice supporting weight gain within national guidelines, and vigilance for signs of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Intrapartum care includes mechanical cervical ripening measures, patience with prolonged labor, and uterotonic medication readiness in the event of postpartum hemorrhage. Postpartum care includes thrombus risk amelioration through early ambulation, use of compression stockings, and anticoagulation. Delays in lactogenesis II can be offset by measures to support early breastfeeding.

Selection stands as an alternative to essentialist thinking, as a generalized and multiply applicable concept, and as a causal explanation for current forms within biology and behavior. Attempts to describe selection processes in a generalizable way have provided clarity about their minimal elements, such as replicators and interactors. This paper discusses the interconnectedness among different levels of selection using evidence garnered from evolutionary biology, development, epigenetics, neuroscience, and behavior analysis. Currently, it appears that replicators and interactors may be more fluid than previously supposed and that selection for particular traits may rely on both multiple levels of interaction and multiple levels of replication. Replicators, interactors, and environment share influence on one another, and different replicators may exchange critical control over similar interactor variation as evolution proceeds. Our current understanding of selection continues to undergo revision, and reference to a number of disparate fields can help to account for the complexity of these processes. An understanding of their interconnectedness may help resolve some mysteries that develop in fields that exclusively focus on one or a few, such as the focused study of behavior.","[Becker, April M.] Univ North Texas, Dept Behav Anal, Denton, TX 76203 USA",,,0,APR,2019,161,,10.1016/j.beproc.2018.01.002,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology"

Five online databases were searched for relevant studies up to December 2017. Systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depressive symptoms were included. Seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Three of these reviews conducted meta-analyses, out of which, two concluded that probiotics improved depressive symptoms in the sample population. Out of the four reviews that conducted qualitative analysis, three reviews concluded that probiotics have the potential to be used as a treatment. Due to the differences in clinical trials, a definitive effect of probiotics on depressive symptoms cannot be concluded.

Moreover, some stressors result in adaptations and demonstrations of later-life resiliency. This review explores the underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity that follow some of these early life experiences and translates them into ideas for interventions in pediatric settings.

These responses are quite frequent in the present competitive world. The aim of this review is to explore the effect of stress on gut microbiota. First, we summarize evidence of where the microbiota composition has changed as a response to a stressful situation, and thereby the effect of the stress response. Likewise, we review different interventions that can modulate microbiota and could modulate the stress according to the underlying mechanisms whereby the gut-brain axis influences stress. Finally, we review both preclinical and clinical studies that provide evidence of the effect of gut modulation on stress. In conclusion, the influence of stress on gut microbiota and gut microbiota on stress modulation is clear for different stressors, but although the preclinical evidence is so extensive, the clinical evidence is more limited. A better understanding of the mechanism underlying stress modulation through the microbiota may open new avenues for the design of therapeutics that could boost the pursued clinical benefits. These new designs should not only focus on stress but also on stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression, in both healthy individuals and different populations.","[Molina-Torres, Guadalupe; Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel; Roman, Pablo; Sanchez-Labraca, Nuria; Cardona, Diana] Univ Almeria, Dept Nursing Sci Physiotherapy & Med, Carretera Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain",,,6,APR,2019,30,02-Mar,10.1097/FBP.0000000000000478,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of periodontitis in a population of nonhuman primates, to document features of familial distribution that could reflect heritability and transmission of microbes with enhanced virulence. Material and MethodsThis report presents our findings from evaluation of periodontal disease bone defects in skulls from 569 animals (5-31years of age) derived from the skeletons of the rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) of Cayo Santiago derived from eight matrilines over 6-9 generations. The distance from the base of alveolar bone to the cemento-enamel junction on 1(st)/2(nd) premolars and 1(st)/2(nd) molars from all four quadrants was evaluated as a measure of periodontal disease. Additionally, we documented the presence of periodontitis in 79 living descendants within these matrilines. ResultsThe results demonstrated an increased extent and severity of periodontitis with aging across all matrilines. Extensive heterogeneity in disease expression was observed among the animals and this was linked to specific periodontitis susceptible matrilines. Moreover, we identified some matrilines in which the members appeared to show some resistance to more severe disease, even with aging. ConclusionLinking these disease variations to multigenerational matriarchal family units supported familial susceptibility of periodontitis. This familial disease relationship was reinforced by the distribution of naturally-occurring periodontitis in the living descendants.","[Ebersole, Jeffrey L.] Univ Nevada, Sch Dent Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Orraca, Luis] Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Dent Med, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Kensler, Terry B.; Maldonado, Elisabeth] Univ Puerto Rico, Lab Primate Morphol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Gonzalez-Martinez, Janis] Univ Puerto Rico, Caribbean Primate Res Ctr, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Gonzalez, Octavio A.] Univ Kentucky, Coll Dent, Ctr Oral Hlth Res, Lexington, KY USA; [Gonzalez, Octavio A.] Univ Kentucky, Coll Dent, Div Periodontol, Lexington, KY USA","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20 GM103538]; National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [G12RR003051, G12MD007600]; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP); National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5P40OD012217]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health DisparitiesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD); Caribbean Primate Research Center","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Grant/Award Number: P20 GM103538; National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), Grant/Award Number: G12RR003051 and G12MD007600; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP); National Institutes of Health (NIH), Grant/Award Number: 5P40OD012217; Caribbean Primate Research Center; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities",0,APR,2019,54,2,10.1111/jre.12610,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine"

Here, we review the theories behind the development of fatigue in IBD and the role of contributing factors, including nutritional deficiency, inflammation and altered metabolism. We also explore the potential role of the gut microbiome in mediating fatigue and other psychological symptoms through the gut-brain axis. We discuss the efficacy of nutrient repletion and various psychological and pharmacological interventions on relieving fatigue in patients with IBD and expand the discussion to non-IBD-related fatigue when evidence exists. Finally, we present a therapeutic strategy for the management of fatigue in IBD and call for further mechanistic and clinical research into this poorly studied symptom.","[Borren, Nienke Z.; Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Borren, Nienke Z.; van der Woude, C.

Forty-eight human (seven infant/child, thirty-six young/middle-aged adult, five older adult) and fifty-eight non-human (twenty-five rat, twenty-seven mouse, five zebrafish, one quail) investigations met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of probiotic strains, sub strains, and study methodologies limited our ability to conduct meta-analyses. Human trials detected variations in anxiety, depression, or emotional regulation (single-strain 55.6%; multi strain 50.0%) and cognition or social functioning post-probiotic intake (single-strain 25.9%; multi-strain 31.5%). For the non-human studies, single- (60.5%) and multi-strain (45.0%) combinations modified stress, anxiety, or depression behaviors in addition to altering social or cognitive performance (single-strain 57.9%; multi-strain 85.0%). Rigorous trials that confirm existing findings, investigate additional probiotic strain/substrain combinations, and test novel experimental paradigms, are necessary to develop future probiotic treatments that successfully target specific neuropsychiatric outcomes.","[Joseph, Jamie M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Law, Catrin] San Diego State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","2016 UC San Diego Frontiers Innovation Scholars Program; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH019934, T32MH018399]","The authors thank Hayley Palmer for her assistance with the initial literature search.

Several approaches to quantify biological age have been utilized, including the use of biomarkers in the form of serum analytes, epigenetic markers, and deficit or frailty indices. Among these methods, the deficit index possesses a theoretical basis grounded in systems biology by incorporating networks, with their emergent properties, to describe the complex aging system. Application of the deficit index in human aging studies points to the increased energetic demands posed by an aging system that is losing integration. Different aspects of mitochondrial function appear to be responsible in males and females. The gut microbiome loses complexity in tandem with the host, as biological age increases, with likely impact on host metabolism and immunity. Specific DNA methylation changes are associated with biological age. They suggest declining connectivity within the aging network, at the cellular level. The deficit/frailty index may account for at least part of the departure at older ages of the observed mortality in the population from the exponential increase modeled by the Gompertz equation.","[Jazwinski, S.

One of the findings that has spiked interest herein, is an apparent link between autoimmune diseases and psychotic disorders. This is supported by genetic findings associating immune-related genetic markers with schizophrenia and clinical studies finding increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with psychosis. Several large-scale epidemiologic studies have found positive associations between autoimmune diseases and psychosis. Particularly, autoimmune diseases as multiple sclerosis and lupus are known to have higher frequencies of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, compared to healthy controls. Cross sectional studies have found higher prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses among those with autoimmune diseases, and longitudinal studies have shown bidirectional associations between several autoimmune diseases and increased risks associated with schizophrenia. Moreover, a family history of autoimmune diseases has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders and vice versa. In this review we will summarize the epidemiologic evidence on associations between autoimmune diseases and psychosis. Possible mechanisms accountable for the association will be discussed, amongst others the probable role of shared genetic risk factors, the impact of infections on both autoimmunity and the development of psychotic disorders, and the potential role of the microbiome. We discuss the findings on and influence of autoantibodies and dysregulation of T- and B-cells in both disease categories, and why further research hereon is needed. In addition to the potential importance of autoimmunity in etiological mechanisms of psychotic disorders, the association also brings important attention to somatic comorbidity in patients with psychotic disorders.","[Jeppesen, Rose; Benros, Michael Eriksen] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Gentofte Hosp, Mental Hlth Ctr Copenhagen, Hellerup, Denmark",Independent Research Fund Denmark [7025-00078B]; Lundbeck FoundationLundbeckfonden [R268-2016-3925],The work was funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant number 7025-00078B) and by an unrestricted grant from The Lundbeck Foundation (grant number R268-2016-3925).

It is now possible to obtain vast quantities of DNA data from ancient specimens in a high-throughput manner and use this information to investigate the dynamics and evolution of past microbial communities. However, we still know very little about how the characteristics of ancient DNA influence our ability to accurately assign microbial taxonomies (i.e. identify species) within ancient metagenomic samples. Here, we use both simulated and published metagenomic data sets to investigate how ancient DNA characteristics affect alignment-based taxonomic classification. We find that nucleotide-to-nucleotide, rather than nucleotide-to-protein, alignments are preferable when assigning taxonomies to short DNA fragment lengths routinely identified within ancient specimens (<60 bp). We determine that deamination (a form of ancient DNA damage) and random sequence substitutions corresponding to similar to 100,000 years of genomic divergence minimally impact alignment-based classification. We also test four different reference databases and find that database choice can significantly bias the results of alignment-based taxonomic classification in ancient metagenomic studies. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of previously published ancient dental calculus data, increasing the number of microbial DNA sequences assigned taxonomically by an average of 64.2-fold and identifying microbial species previously unidentified in the original study. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how ancient DNA characteristics influence alignment-based taxonomic classification of ancient microorganisms and provides recommendations for future palaeomicrobiological studies.","[Eisenhofer, Raphael; Weyrich, Laura Susan] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Eisenhofer, Raphael; Weyrich, Laura Susan] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Excellence Australia Biodivers & Heritage, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Australian Research Council (ARC): DECRAAustralian Research Council [DE150101574]; ARC Centre of Excellence CABAH [CE170100015],"This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC): DECRA (DE150101574) and ARC Centre of Excellence CABAH (CE170100015).

We enrolled 45 children with ASD (6-9 years of age; 39 boys and 6 girls) and 45 sex-and age-matched neurotypical children. Dietary and other socio-demographic information was obtained via questionnaires. We characterized the composition of the fecal microbiota using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing. The ASD group showed less diversity and richness of gut microbiota than the neurotypical group, as estimated by the abundance-based coverage estimator index and the phylogenetic diversity index. The analysis of beta diversity showed an altered microbial community structure in the ASD group. After adjustment for confounders and multiple testing corrections, no significant group difference was found in the relative abundance of microbiota on the level of the phylum. At the family level, children with ASD had a lower relative abundance of Acidaminococcaceae than the healthy controls. Moreover, a decrease in the relative abundance of genera Lachnoclostridium, Tyzzerella subgroup 4, Flavonifractor, and unidentified Lachnospiraceae was observed in ASD group.

Genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors are all considered to play a role. The importance of gut flora and its influence on the central nervous system has been recognized in recent years. We hypothesize that gut flora may be a converging point where environmental factors interact with epigenetic factors and contribute to SZ pathogenesis. Aim: To summarize the current understanding of genetic and epigenetic factors and the possible involvement of gut flora in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Results: We searched PubMed and Medline with a combination of the key words schizophrenia, microbiome, epigenetic factors to identify studies of genetic and epigenetic factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Numerous genes that encode key proteins in neuronal signaling pathways have been linked to SZ. Epigenetic modifications, particularly, methylation and acetylation profiles, have been found to differ in individuals that present with SZ from those that don't. Gut flora may affect epigenetic modifications by regulation of key metabolic pathway molecules, including methionine, florate, biotin, and metabolites that are acetyl group donors. Despite a lack of direct studies on the subject, it is possible that gut flora may influence genetic and epigenetic expression and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of SZ. Conclusion: Gut flora is sensitive to both internal and environmental stimuli and the synthesis of some key molecules that participate in the epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Therefore, it is possible that gut flora is a converging point where environmental factors interact with genetic and epigenetic factors in the pathogenesis of SZ.","[Zhuo, Chuanjun; Liu, Chuanxin; Chen, Min; Ji, Feng] Jining Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, Psychiat Genet, Jining 272191, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Chuanjun; Li, Jie; Tian, Hongjun] Tianjin Med Univ, Tianjin Anding Hosp, Tianjin Mental Hlth Ctr,Mental Hlth Teaching Hosp, Dept Psychiat Neuroimaging Genet Lab,Dept Psychia, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Chuanjun; Jiang, Deguo; Lin, Chongguang; Chen, Ce] Wenzhou Seventh Peoples Hosp, Dept Mental Hlth, Psychiat Genet, 552 Xishandong Rd, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yudong] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Xu, Yong] Shanxi Med Univ, Clin Med Coll 1, Hosp 1, Dept Psychiat, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81871052]; Tianjin Health Bureau Foundation [2014KR02]; Key Projects of Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China [17JCZDJC35700]","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81871052 to C.Z.), Tianjin Health Bureau Foundation (2014KR02 to C.Z.) and the Key Projects of Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China (17JCZDJC35700 to C.Z.).",1,Mar-02,2019,90,,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.11.005,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry

Yet, the pathways linking caesareans to later health outcomes are not well understood, particularly in dual burden contexts. We test two of the hypothesized pathways, altered immune function and gut microbiota, which may link delivery mode to later health outcomes and test whether these associations persist when controlling for postnatal nutritional and pathogenic exposures. Methods: Data come from infants, aged 0 to 2 (n = 41), and young children, aged 2 to 11 (n = 135), from the Galapagos, Ecuador. Differences in morbidity, C-reactive protein (CRP), and gut microbiota by delivery type were tested using linear and logistic regression models adjusted for nutritional and pathogenic exposures and infant age. Results: Over half of infants and over 40% of children were delivered by caesarean. Morbidity and CRP did not differ between infants or children born by caesarean or vaginally. Microbial taxa abundance differed by delivery mode. Infants born by caesarean had a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a lower relative abundance of Bacteroidales. Children born by caesarean had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriales. These differences remained after adjustment for environmental exposure. Conclusions: Caesarean delivery is associated with differences in gut microbiota across childhood even in this dual burden context. Our results highlight the importance of examining caesarean delivery across diverse contexts to better understand the impact of perinatal interventions on short-and longer-term health outcomes.","[Thompson, Amanda L.; Houck, Kelly M.; Jahnke, Johanna R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Anthropol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Thompson, Amanda L.] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Thompson, Amanda L.; Jahnke, Johanna R.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA","Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences [BCS-1341156]; Institute for Global Health and Infectious Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Triangle Center for Evolutionary Medicine; University Research Council, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [P2C HD050924]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Carolina Population Center; Global Health; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Grant/Award Number: BCS-1341156; Institute for Global Health and Infectious Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Triangle Center for Evolutionary Medicine; University Research Council, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Grant/Award Number: P2C HD050924; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Carolina Population Center; Global Health; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Wenner-Gren Foundation; National Science Foundation",0,MAR-APR,2019,31,2,10.1002/ajhb.23219,Anthropology; Biology

The gut microbiome is a key component of this axis. Gut bacteria can communicate with the brain through a variety of pathways including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune modulation, tryptophan metabolism and the production of various neuroactive compounds. Patients with depression, and other mood and anxiety disorders, show distinct compositional changes in their gut bacteria profile, raising the question about a possible aetiological role for the microbiome in these disorders. Evidence is emerging that the gut microbiome may represent a new potential antidepressant target and the term 'psychobiotic' has been coined to describe bacteria which confer mental health benefits. Gut bacteria are easily accessible and can be altered in a variety of ways including through the use of probiotics, prebiotics and dietary change. Psychobiotics containing various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have demonstrated the ability to improve mood, reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive function in both healthy populations and patient groups. This article provides an overview of the identification and development of antidepressant psychobiotics, from the preclinical evidence in the laboratory to the more recent encouraging results from human trials.","[Butler, Mary I.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat, Cork, Ireland; [Butler, Mary I.; Sandhu, Kiran; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Sandhu, Kiran] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland; [Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat, Psychiat, Cork, Ireland","Science Foundation IrelandScience Foundation Ireland [SFI/12/RC/2273]; Health Research Board of Ireland [HRA_POR/2011/23, HRA_POR/2012/32]; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme Grant MyNewGut","The authors are supported in part by Science Foundation Ireland in the form of a centre grant (Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2273); by the Health Research Board of Ireland (Grant Numbers HRA_POR/2011/23 and HRA_POR/2012/32) and received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme Grant MyNewGut under Grant Agreement No. FP7/2007-2013.

By the 1990s, the concept of planetary health was part of the fabric of integrative medicine; more recently, after the 2015 Lancet Commission on Planetary Health report, the concept has penetrated mainstream academic and medical discourse. Here, we explore this history and describe its relevance to contemporary healthcare; integrative medicine is uniquely positioned to educate and advocate on behalf of patients and communities (current and future generations), helping to safeguard health of person, place and planet. We use the emerging microbiome science as a way to illustrate the interconnectivity and health implications of ecosystems (including social/political/economic systems) at all scales. As highlighted in the Canmore Declaration, mainstream planetary health discourse will be strengthened by inter-professional healthcare perspectives, and a more sophisticated understanding of the ways in which social dominance orientation and medical authoritarianism compromise the World Health Organization's broad vision of global health. Planetary health isn't a ""new discipline""; it is merely an extension of a concept that was understood by our ancestors, and remains the vocation of all healthcare providers. Discourse on the topic requires cultural competency, critical consciousness and a greater appreciation of marginalized voices.","[Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Princess Margaret Hosp, Sch Med, 15 Hosp Ave, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Prescott, Susan L.; Logan, Alan C.] WUN, In VIVO Global Initiat, Res Grp, 6010 Pk Ave,Suite 4081, West New York, NY 07093 USA",,,4,MAR-APR,2019,15,2,10.1016/j.explore.2018.09.002,Integrative & Complementary Medicine

Climate change and increased global connectivity are amplifying the scale of the monitoring challenge, with the number of new plant biosecurity threats increasing each year. Citizen science can increase the scale of pest and disease surveys. However, it is argued that citizen science data can be biased and inaccurate. This study examines potential biases in citizen science data by focusing on the case study of acute oak decline (AOD), a disease syndrome impacting native oaks within the UK associated with the beetle Agrilus biguttatus. Analysis was performed using two contrasting citizen science data set sources: the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas, which is a repository for citizen science data sets, and Tree Alert, a targeted citizen science project that encouraged landowners and the public to report the occurrence of AOD. For both data sets, detection was more likely in locations with higher Coleoptera reports, suggesting that there are hubs of recorder activity. For the NBN data set, A. biguttatus was more likely to be found in areas where historic parks and gardens were present. For the Tree Alert data set, A. biguttatus was less likely to be found on open access land, indicating that the programme was successful in engaging private landowners. These results indicate that understanding sources of bias within reporting schemes is an important step in data analysis and that the inclusion of structured survey designs would enable the extent of biases to be documented.","[Baker, E.; Jeger, M.

Design: Comparative descriptive pilot study design. Setting: Urban area in the southeastern United States. Participants: Thirty-four African American women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Based on visual assessment, participants were placed in two groups: healthy gingiva and gingivitis. Saliva samples were analyzed for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP). DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque samples, and amplicons of the fourth hypervariable region were sequenced. Results: We found no differences in overall microbiome diversity between the healthy gingiva (n = 22) and the gingivitis (n = 12) groups although significant differences were found among the bacterial taxa present. The gingivitis group had greater levels of salivary IL-1b and MMP-8, whereas CRP was not different between groups. Overall microbiome diversity was positively associated with the CRP level. We found no significant relationships among the subgingival microbiome, periodontal inflammation, and preterm birth. Conclusion: Gingivitis in pregnancy did not appear to shift the overall composition or diversity of the subgingival microbiome although differences in several bacterial taxa suggest that inflamed gingiva in pregnant women are associated with a disruption in the stability of the subgingival microbiome. A correlation between the abundance of bacteria and CRP also suggests an association between the microbiome and systemic inflammation. These findings provide support for future research about how the oral microbiome and progression of periodontal disease in pregnant women link with adverse pregnancy outcomes.","[Yang, Irene; Corwin, Elizabeth J.] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, 1520 Clifton Rd NE,Room 424, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Knight, Anna K.] Emory Univ, Grad Div Biol & Biomed Sci, Genet & Mol Biol Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Dunlop, Anne L.] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Corwin, Elizabeth J.] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, Res, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",AWHONN Novice Researcher Award; Alpha Epsilon chapter of Sigma,Supported in part by the AWHONN Novice Researcher Award and an award from the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Sigma.,0,MAR,2019,48,2,10.1016/j.jogn.2018.12.003,Nursing; Obstetrics & Gynecology

Products of microbiota can affect methylation according to preclinical studies. The current investigation aimed at analyzing the correlation between gut microbiome diversity and the methylation of the clock gene ARNTL in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from fasting blood of study participants with BD (n = 32). The methylation analysis of the ARNTL CG site cg05733463 was performed by bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA with the Epitect kit, PCR and pyrosequencing. Additionally, DNA was extracted from stool samples and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. QIIME was used to analyze microbiome data. Results Methylation status of the ARNTL CpG position cg05733463 correlated significantly with bacterial diversity (Simpson index: r=-0.389, p=0.0238) and evenness (Simpson evenness index: r=-0.358, p=0.044). Furthermore, bacterial diversity differed significantly between euthymia and depression (F(1,30) =4.695, p=0.039). Discussion The results of our pilot study show that bacterial diversity differs between euthymia and depression. Interestingly, gut microbiome diversity and evenness correlate negatively with methylation of ARNTL, which is known to regulate monoamine oxidase A transcription. We propose that alterations in overall diversity of the gut microbiome represent an internal environmental factor that has an epigenetic impact on the clock gene ARNTL which is thought to be involved in BD pathogenesis.","[Bengesser, S.

Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood-brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function. Here, we discuss three such pathways: endogenous benzodiazepine synthesis, production of queuine/queuosine, and excretion of dietary mercury.

Although most DNA within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted enrichment techniques. Materials and methods Total DNA extracted from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in-solution hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing. Results Total DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted in up to four-fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some loss in complexity. Recovering more on-target reads for the same sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA, comparison of phylum-level microbial community structure revealed few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries, indicating that off-target sequences in human genome-enriched calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome reconstruction. Discussion While ancient human dental calculus does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues. Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method can be routinely applied to archaeological samples.","[Ziesemer, Kirsten A.; Hoogland, Menno; Hofman, Corinne L.; Schroeder, Hannes] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Ramos-Madrigal, Jazmin; Schroeder, Hannes] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mann, Allison E.; Sankaranarayanan, Krithivasan; Hofman, Courtney A.; Lewis, Cecil M., Jr.; Warinner, Christina] Univ Oklahoma, Labs Mol Anthropol & Microbiome Res, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Mann, Allison E.; Sankaranarayanan, Krithivasan; Hofman, Courtney A.; Lewis, Cecil M., Jr.; Warinner, Christina] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Anthropol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Brandt, Bernd W.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Ctr Dent Amsterdam, Dept Prevent Dent, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brandt, Bernd W.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sankaranarayanan, Krithivasan] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Ozga, Andrew T.; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ozga, Andrew T.; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ozga, Andrew T.; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolut & Med, Tempe, AZ USA; [Salazar-Garcia, Domingo C.; Warinner, Christina] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeogenet, Jena, Germany; [Salazar-Garcia, Domingo C.] IKERBASQUE Basque Fdn Sci, Grp Invest Prehist IT 622 13, UPV EHU, Vitoria, Spain; [Frohlich, Bruno] Dept Anthropol, Hanover, NH USA; [Milner, George R.] Penn State Univ, Dept Anthropol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Aldenderfer, Mark] Univ Calif, Dept Anthropol & Heritage Studies, Merced, CA USA","H2020 European Research Council [319209]; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [649307DK-TAF 5662]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1516633, BCS-1528698]","H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 319209; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 649307DK-TAF 5662; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: BCS 1516633, BCS-1528698",0,MAR,2019,168,3,10.1002/ajpa.23763,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

Exciting pilot studies suggest probiotic applications to the gut can reduce anxiety and depression via the vagus nerve. But not to diminish such findings, much still needs to be considered, including the fact that the vagus nerve links to many other body sites that also host a microbiome. Questions remain that touch the core of being human: (i) Do our microbes influence happiness and to what extent? (ii) What components of the gut microbiota and their function, including as it relates to mental health, are critical and how do they differ between agile, fit hunter gatherers and obese westerners or Danes described as the happiest people on the planet? (iii) What role do environmental pollutants play in this microbes-host ecosystem? While approaching life from a reductionist perspective has a long history in science, we need to try to interrogate these health and disease issues from a wider perspective.

This study investigated the effect of consuming the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and explored its effect on immune products such as cytokines and chemokines. Methods: In this open-label single-arm study, all participants received B. breve strain A-1 (10(11) cfu/day) for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of observation. The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score. Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), blood test findings, and fecal microbiome composition. Results: Twenty-nine outpatients completed the study. HADS total score and PANSS anxiety/depression score were significantly improved at 4 weeks. Based on the criterion of a greater than 25% reduction in HADS total score at 4 weeks from baseline, there were 12 responders and 17 non-responders. Responders were found to have fewer negative symptoms, reduced intake of dairy products, and higher relative abundance of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome than non-responders. Moreover, IL-22 and TRANCE expression was significantly increased at 4 weeks from baseline in responders but not in non-responders. Limitations: This open-label, single-arm study cannot exclude a placebo effect. Conclusions: The results suggest the potential effect of B. breve A-1 in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Further studies should investigate this effect in patients with other psychiatric conditions and assess dietary habits and the gut microbiome.","[Okubo, Ryo; Koga, Minori; Matsuyama, Shiina; Oka, Matsuhiko; Narita, Hisashi; Hashimoto, Naoki; Kusumi, Ichiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, West 7,North 15, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Okubo, Ryo; Matsuoka, Yutaka J.] Natl Canc Ctr Japan, Ctr Publ Hlth Sci, Div Hlth Care Res, Chuo Ku, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Katsumata, Noriko; Odamaki, Toshitaka; Xiao, Jinzhong] Morinaga Milk Ind Co Ltd, Next Generat Sci Inst, Zama, Kanagawa, Japan","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17H04253]","Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd. provided the test samples (Bifidobacterium breve A-1) and conducted analyses of the gut micro-biome.

A lingering controversy is whether the dingo has been tamed and has now reverted to its ancestral wild state or whether its ancestors were domesticated and it now resides on the continent as a feral dog. The goal of this article is to place the discussion onto a theoretical framework, highlight what is currently known about dingo origins and taxonomy and then make a series of experimentally testable organismal, cellular and biochemical predictions that we propose can focus future research. Discussion We consider a canid that has been unconsciously selected as a tamed animal and the endpoint of methodical or what we now call artificial selection as a domesticated animal. We consider wild animals that were formerly tamed as untamed and those wild animals that were formerly domesticated as feralized. Untamed canids are predicted to be marked by a signature of unconscious selection whereas feral animals are hypothesized to be marked by signatures of both unconscious and artificial selection. First, we review the movement of dingo ancestors into Australia. We then discuss how differences between taming and domestication may influence the organismal traits of skull morphometrics, brain and size, seasonal breeding, and sociability. Finally, we consider cellular and molecular level traits including hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic position of dingoes, metabolic genes that appear to be under positive selection and the potential for micronutrient compensation by the gut microbiome. Conclusions Western Australian Government policy is currently being revised to allow the widespread killing of the Australian dingo. These policies are based on an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary history of the canid and assume the dingo is feralized. However, accumulated evidence does not definitively show that the dingo was ever domesticated and additional focused research is required. We suggest that incorporating ancient DNA data into the debate concerning dingo origins will be pivotal to understanding the evolutionary history of the canid. Further, we advocate that future morphological, behavioural and genetic studies should focus on including genetically pure Alpine and Desert dingoes and not dingo-dog hybrids. Finally, we propose that future studies critically examine genes under selection in the dingo and employ the genome from a wild canid for comparison.","[Ballard, J.

Evidence is mounting on the causal role of an altered gut microbiome in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and diabetes, and psychiatric diseases like anxiety and depression. Mechanisms include altered energy harvest from food, hormonal changes, increased gut permeability, inflammation, immune response, and a direct influence on the brain and behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the third most common disease in adolescence and exacts a high burden on patients and caregivers. It often becomes chronic and has the highest mortality of all psychiatric diseases. As AN is characterized by nutritional restrictions, weight loss, and severe behavioral symptoms including weight phobia, comorbid anxiety and depression, accompanied by endocrine alterations, increased inflammation, and immune response, exploring the role of the gut microbiome is crucial. Here, we present an overview of the potential mechanisms of interaction between the gut microbiome, the host and particularly the brain in AN and summarize the initial findings of microbiome research on AN. We conclude by identifying future research directions and potential therapeutic approaches, including nutritional interventions, probiotics, prebiotics and food supplements, that could become important additions to current AN therapy.","[Seitz, Jochen; Schulz, Nina; Herpertz-Dahlmann, Beate] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Univ Hosp, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany; [Belheouane, Meriem; Baines, John F.] Univ Kiel, Inst Expt Med, Plon, Germany; [Belheouane, Meriem; Baines, John F.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Plon, Germany; [Dempfle, Astrid] Univ Kiel, Inst Med Informat & Stat, Kiel, Germany","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 2107, DE 1614/3-1, DE 1614/3-2]","This study was supported by grants from the German Research Foundation (FOR 2107, Grant No. DE 1614/3-1 and DE 1614/3-2).",3,Feb-12,2019,10,,10.3389/fendo.2019.00041,Endocrinology & Metabolism

Bacterial transplantation from MDD patients to rodents produces depression-like behaviors. In humans, case-control studies have examined the gut microbiome in healthy and affected individuals. We systematically reviewed existing studies comparing gut microbial composition in MDD and healthy volunteers. Methods: A PubMed literature search combined the terms ""depression,"" ""depressive disorder,"" ""stool,"" ""fecal,"" ""gut,"" and ""microbiome"" to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between MDD and microbiota quantified from stool. We evaluated the resulting studies, focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between MDD and healthy controls. Results: Six eligible studies were found in which 50 taxa exhibited differences (p < 0.05) between patients with MDD and controls. Patient characteristics and methodologies varied widely between studies. Five phyla-Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Protobacteria-were represented; however, divergent results occurred across studies for all phyla. The largest number of differentiating taxa were within phylum Firmicutes, in which nine families and 12 genera differentiated the diagnostic groups. The majority of these families and genera were found to be statistically different between the two groups in two identified studies. Family Lachnospiraceae differentiated the diagnostic groups in four studies (with an even split in directionality). Across all five phyla, nine genera were higher in MDD (Anaerostipes, Blautia, Clostridium, Klebsiella, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus), six were lower (Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Escherichia/Shigella, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus), and six were divergent (Alistipes, Bacteroides, Megamonas, Oscillibacter, Prevotella, and Roseburia). We highlight mechanisms and products of bacterial metabolism as they may relate to the etiology of depression. Conclusions: No consensus has emerged from existing human studies of depression and gut microbiome concerning which bacterial taxa are most relevant to depression. This may in part be due to differences in study design. Given that bacterial functions are conserved across taxonomic groups, we propose that studying microbial functioning may be more productive than a purely taxonomic approach to understanding the gut microbiome in depression.","[Cheung, Stephanie G.] Columbia Univ, Div Consultat Liaison Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Cheung, Stephanie G.; Goldenthal, Ariel R.; Mann, J.

However, with the emergence of new Web media platforms and the ubiquity of social media, the issue has taken on a new dimension and urgency. At the same time, many established existing information quality evaluation guidelines address information characteristics other than the content (eg, authority and currency), target information creators rather than users as their main audience, or do not address information presented via novel Web technologies. Objective: The aim of this formative study was to (1) develop a methodological approach for analyzing health-related Web pages and (2) apply it to a set of relevant Web pages. Methods: This qualitative study analyzed 25 type 2 diabetes pages, which were derived from the results of a Google search with the keywords ""diabetes,"" ""reversal,"" and ""natural."" The coding scheme, developed via a combination of theory- and data-driven approaches, includes 5 categories from existing guidelines (resource type, information authority, validity of background information sources, objectivity, and currency) and 7 novel categories (treatment or reversal method, promises and certainty, criticisms of establishment, emotional appeal, vocabulary, rhetoric and presentation, and use of science in argumentation). The coding involves both categorical judgment and in-depth narrative characterization. On establishing satisfactory level of agreement on the narrative coding, the team coded the complete dataset of 25 pages. Results: The results set included ""traditional"" static pages, videos, and digitized versions of printed newspapers or magazine articles. Treatments proposed by the pages included a mixture of conventional evidence-based treatments (eg, healthy balanced diet exercise) and unconventional treatments (eg, dietary supplements, optimizing gut flora). Most pages either promised or strongly implied high likelihood of complete recovery. Pages varied greatly with respect to the authors' stated background and credentials as well as the information sources they referenced or mentioned. The majority included criticisms of the traditional health care establishment. Many sold commercial products ranging from dietary supplements to books. The pages frequently used colloquial language. A significant number included emotional personal anecdotes, made positive mentions of the word cure, and included references to nature as a positive healing force. Most pages presented some biological explanations of their proposed treatments. Some of the explanations involved the level of complexity well beyond the level of an educated layperson. Conclusions: Both traditional and data-driven categories of codes used in this work yielded insights about the resources and highlighted challenges faced by their users. This exploratory study underscores the challenges of consumer health information seeking and the importance of developing support tools that would help users seek, evaluate, and analyze information in the changing digital ecosystem.","[Keselman, Alla] NIH, Div Specialized Informat Serv, Natl Lib Med, 6707 Democracy Blvd,MSC 5467, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Smith, Catherine Arnott] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA; [Murcko, Anita C.; Kaufman, David R.] Arizona State Univ, Scottsdale, AZ USA",National Library of MedicineUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM),The work was in part supported by the intramural research program of the National Library of Medicine.,2,Feb-08,2019,21,2,10.2196/11129,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics

Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the potential to open a new front in the war of our wits against their genes (Joshua Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way, these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is evidence that microbes previously thought of at best benign may actually enhance human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous benign or health-promoting microbiomes but they may converge. A microbial Neolithic revolution is a possible future in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes. The complex interactions of individual rights, community health, pathogen contagion, the spread of benign, and of health-promoting microbiomes including infectious vaccines require study. Advancing the detailed understanding of heterogeneity in microbial spread is very likely to yield important insights relevant to public health.","[Thaler, David S.] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Klingelbergstr 50-70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Head, Michael G.] Univ Southampton, Univ Hosp Southampton, Clin Informat Res Unit, Fac Med, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 6YD, Hants, England; [Horsley, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Mills Rd, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Alfred P.

In animals, probiotics reverse gut microbiome-related alterations in depression-like symptoms, in cognition, and in hormonal stress response. However, in humans, a causal understanding of the gut-brain link in emotion and cognition is lacking. Additionally, whether the effects of probiotics on neurocognition are visible only in presence of stress, remains unclear. We investigated the effects of a multispecies probiotic (Ecologic (R) Barrier) on specific neurocognitive measures of emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and cognitive control using fMRI. Critically, we also tested whether probiotics can buffer against the detrimental effects of acute stress on working memory. In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subjects intervention study, 58 healthy participants were tested once before and once after a 28-day intervention. Without stress induction, probiotics did not affect brain, behavioral, or related self-report measures. However, relative to placebo, the probiotics group did show a significant stress-related increase in working memory performance after supplementation. This change was associated with intervention-related neural changes in frontal cortex during cognitive control exclusively in the probiotics group. Overall, our results show neurocognitive effects of a multispecies probiotic in healthy women only under challenging situations, buffering against the detrimental effects of stress on cognition.","[Papalini, S.; Michels, F.; Kohn, N.; Wegman, J.; Roelofs, K.; Aarts, E.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Cognit Neuroimagirg, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Hemert, S.] Winclove Probiot, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Arias-Vasquez, A.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Psychiat, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Arias-Vasquez, A.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Human Genet & Cognit Neurosci, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs under the TKI Life Science and Health [LSHM15034]; Winclove Probiotics B.V., The Netherlands; Food, Cognition and Behavior grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [057-14-001]; Veni grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [016.135.023]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC_StG2012_313749]; VICI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-12-001]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [643051, 728018]","The study was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs under the TKI Life Science and Health, project LSHM15034, and by Winclove Probiotics B.V., The Netherlands.

Animal studies have indicated that maternal gut microbiota is related to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mouse offspring, while it is unclear whether there is a correlation between gut microbiota of ASD children and their mothers. We examined the relationships between gut microbiome profiles of ASD children and those of their mothers, and evaluated the clinical discriminatory power of discovered bacterial biomarkers. Gut microbiome was profiled and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in stool samples of 59 mother-child pairs of ASD children and 30 matched mother-child pairs of healthy children. Significant differences were observed in the gut microbiome composition between ASD and healthy children in our Chinese cohort. Several unique bacterial biomarkers, such as Alcaligenaceae and Acinetobacter, were identified. Mothers of ASD children had more Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Moraxellaceae, and Acinetobacter than mothers of healthy children. There was a clear correlation between gut microbiome profiles of children and their mothers; however, children with ASD still had unique bacterial biomarkers, such as Alcaligenaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridium. Candidate biomarkers discovered in this study had remarkable discriminatory power. The identified patterns of mother-child gut microbiome profiles may be important for assessing risks during the early stage and planning of personalized treatment and prevention of ASD via microbiota modulation.","[Li, Ning; Yang, Junjie; Zhang, Jiaming; Wang, Ying; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Lehai; Gai, Zhongtao; Zhang, Lei] Shandong Univ, Shandong Childrens Microbiome Ctr, Qilu Childrens Hosp, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Li, Guimei] Shandong Univ, Dept Pediat, Shandong Prov Hosp, Jinan 250021, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin; Zhang, Lei] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data Based Precis Med, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying; Zhang, Guangye; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Lehai; Gai, Zhongtao] Shandong Univ, Res Inst Pediat, Qilu Childrens Hosp, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Zhao, Dongmei] Shandong Univ, Inst Child Hlth Care, Qilu Childrens Hosp, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Changying; Wang, Jingwen] Qilu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jinan 250200, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liang, Cheng] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250358, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun] Beihang Univ, Sch Chem, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, CAS Key Lab Synthet Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31471202, 81671362]; Medical and Health Science and Technology Development Projects of Shandong Province [2015WSA01023]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program [2016YYSP009, 2018CXGC1219]; City of Weihai Technique Extension Project [2016GNS023]; Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province, China [tshw20120206]","All phases of this study were supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81671362), the Medical and Health Science and Technology Development Projects of Shandong Province (Grant No. 2015WSA01023), and Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2018CXGC1219) to ZG; the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31471202) and the Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2016YYSP009), and the City of Weihai Technique Extension Project (Grant No. 2016GNS023) to LZ.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis is an emerging aspect in the generation of autistic behaviors; evidence from animal models suggests that intestinal microbial shifts may produce changes fitting the clinical picture of autism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fecal metagenomic profiles in children with ASD and compare them with healthy participants. This comparison allows us to ascertain how mental regression (an important variable in ASD) could influence the intestinal microbiota profile. For this reason, a subclassification in children with ASD by mental regression (AMR) and no mental regression (ANMR) phenotype was performed. The present report was a descriptive observational study. Forty-eight children aged 2-6 years with ASD were included: 30 with ANMR and 18 with AMR. In addition, a control group of 57 normally developing children was selected and matched to the ASD group by sex and age. Fecal samples were analyzed with a metagenomic approach using a next-generation sequencing platform. Several differences between children with ASD, compared with the healthy group, were detected. Namely, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at phylum level, as well as, Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Erysipelotrichi, and Gammaproteobacteria at class level were found at higher proportions in children with ASD. Additionally, Proteobacteria levels showed to be augmented exclusively in AMR children. Preliminary results, using a principal component analysis, showed differential patterns in children with ASD, ANMR and AMR, compared to healthy group, both for intestinal microbiota and food patterns. In this study, we report, higher levels of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacilli, aside from Erysipelotrichi, and Gammaproteobacteria in children with ASD compared to healthy group. Furthermore, AMR children exhibited higher levels of Proteobacteria. Further analysis using these preliminary results and mixing metagenomic and other omic technologies are needed in larger cohorts of children with ASD to confirm these intestinal microbiota changes.","[Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Gil, Angel] Univ Granada, Sch Pharm, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol 2, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Gil, Angel] Univ Granada, Ctr Biomed Res, Inst Nutr & Food Technol Jose Mataix, Granada 18016, Spain; [Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Chueca, Natalia; Gil, Angel; Garcia, Federico] Complejo Hosp Univ Granada, Inst Invest Biosanitaria IBS GRANADA, Granada 18014, Spain; [Gomez-Fernandez, Antonio; Jose de la Torre-Aguilar, Maria; Luis Perez-Navero, Juan; Flores-Rojas, Katherine; Gil-Campos, Mercedes] Univ Cordoba, Maimonides Inst Biomed Res Cordoba IMIBIC, Reina Sofia Univ Hosp, Pediat Res & Metab Unit, Cordoba 14010, Spain; [Gil, Angel; Flores-Rojas, Katherine; Gil-Campos, Mercedes] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBEROBN CIBER Physiopathol Obes & Nutr, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Martin-Borreguero, Pilar] Reina Sofia Univ Hosp, Maimonides Inst Biomed Res Cordoba IMIBIC, Dept Child & Adolescent Clin Psychiat & Psychol, Cordoba 14010, Spain; [Solis-Urra, Patricio] Univ Granada, Fac Sport Sci, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, PROFITH PROmoting FITness & Hlth Phys Act Res Grp, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Solis-Urra, Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Phys Educ, IRyS Res Grp, Valparaiso 2374631, Chile; [Javier Ruiz-Ojeda, Francisco] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Helmholtz Diabet Ctr, Inst Diabet & Obes, RG Adipocytes & Metab, D-85748 Munich, Germany",FUNDACIO AGRUPACIO Ambit de la Infancia; Spanish Society of Pediatrics [404]; Red de Salud Materno Infantil (RED SAMID),"This study was supported by the FUNDACIO AGRUPACIO Ambit de la Infancia, 404 Research Grant INVEST from the Spanish Society of Pediatrics and Red de Salud Materno Infantil (RED SAMID).

It was hypothesized that the recommended diet would result in metabolic and gut microbiome changes. The 9-week dietary intervention adhered to the US Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans and focused on increasing fruit and vegetable intake to equal half of the diet. Seventeen eligible young adults with/or at high risk of MetS consented and completed preintervention and postintervention measurements, including anthropometric, body composition, cardiovascular, complete blood lipid panel, and collection of stool sample for microbial analysis. Participants attended weekly consultations to assess food logs, food receipts, and adherence to the diet. Following intention-to-treat guidelines, all 17 individuals were included in the dietary, clinical, and anthropometric analysis. Fruit and vegetable intake increased from 1.6 to 3.4 cups of fruits and vegetables (P < .001) daily. Total fiber (P = .02) and insoluble fiber (P < .0001) also increased. Clinical laboratory changes included an increase in sodium (P = .0006) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .04). In the fecal microbiome, Erysipelotrichaceae (phylum Firmicutes) decreased (log2 fold change: -1.78, P = .01) and Caulobacteraceae (phylum Proteobacteria) increased (log2 fold change = 1.07, P = .01). Implementing a free-living 9-week diet, with intensive education and accountability, gave young adults at high risk for/or diagnosed with MetS the knowledge, skills, and feedback to improve diet. To yield greater impact, a longer diet intervention may be needed in this population. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Several recent clinical studies have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions, although the literature on schizophrenia is quite limited. This study investigated gut microbiome composition in 50 individuals, including 25 persons with chronic schizophrenia and 25 demographically-matched non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs). Stool samples were collected and assayed using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V4 region. Examination of unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity revealed significant community-level separation in microbiome composition between the two subject groups. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria were found to be relatively decreased in schizophrenia subjects compared to NCs. At the genus level, Anaerococcus was relatively increased in schizophrenia while Haemophilus, Sutterella, and Clostridium were decreased. Within individuals with schizophrenia, abundance of Ruminococcaceae was correlated with lower severity of negative symptoms; Bacteroides was associated with worse depressive symptoms; and Coprococcus was related to greater risk for developing coronary heart disease. Our findings provide evidence of altered gut microbial composition in persons with chronic schizophrenia and suggest a need for larger and longitudinal studies of microbiome in schizophrenia.

On the other hand, every third patient with depressive disorder develops an alcohol disorder at some point during his / her life. A crucial link between depression and hepatic disease seems to be inflammatory processes in which the microbiome and increased intestinal permeability of the intestine play a pivotal role. Depression as well as liver disease, alcohol consumption, stress, and aging processes disturb the delicate balance of intestinal microbiota resulting in increased intestinal permeability. Therefore, bacteria or their metabolites such as the endotoxine lipopolysaccharide are able to reach the blood circulation resulting in inflammation in the liver as well as in the brain via a cytokine cascade, which in turn can lead to liver changes, depression, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, liver values, blood glucose levels, and metabolic parameters should be closely monitored in patients with depressive disorders, and in the case of patients with hepatic diseases, increased attention should be given to depressive symptoms, diabetes and obesity.","[Kahl, Kai G.; Krueger, Tillmann] Hannover Med Sch, Klin Psychiat Sozialpsychiat & Psychotherapie, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Kahl, Kai G.; Eckermann, Gabriel] Arbeitsgrp Polypharm, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neuropsychopharmakol & Pharma, Berlin, Germany; [Wedemeyer, Heiner] Med Hsch Hannover Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endokri, Klin Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endokrinol, Hannover, Germany",,,1,FEB,2019,87,1,10.1055/s-0043-123068,Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry

Alpha diversity (AD) represents the number of different bacterial species in the gut. Reduced AD and a leaky gut (zonulin) lead to inflammation and changes in nutrient absorption.

Furthermore, Zonulin as an indicator of gut barrier function and inflammation parameters were investigated. Results AN patients had significantly lower AD compared to NC (number of observed species p=0.042, Chao1 Diversity Index p=0.043). Zonulin was not significantly altered in AN patients compared to NC. There were no significant correlations of serum parameters and AD. Discussion Regardless of gut permeability, AN patients showed significantly decreased AD compared to NC. Decreased AD can have an additional negative impact on calorie intake in AN.

Gut-brain axis dysfunction, antibacterial activity, and modulatory effects of antidepressants toward intestinal bacteria have been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of hospital stay, including escitalopram administration, on gut microbiota in patients with depressive episodes. Methods: After admission to the hospital and 7-days washout from all medications the composition of fecal microbiota samples was evaluated at baseline (W0) and after 6 weeks (W6), using 16S rRNA sequencing. The study was conducted on 17 inpatients (52.9% females), who followed the same daily hospital routine, including a standard diet and received 5-20 mg daily doses of escitalopram. Results: At the end of treatment (W6), no change was observed in the Chao1 index. However, Shannon (median (Q1-Q3): W0 2.78 (2.67-3.02) vs. W6 3.11 (2.80-3.30)), and inverse Simpson (median (Q1-Q3): W0 9.26 (7.26-13.76) vs. W6 12.13 (9.17-15.73)) indices increased significantly compared to baseline values (False Discovery Rate p (q) = 0.031 and q = 0.011, respectively). We also found that between-subject W0 Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were significantly higher than W0-W6 within-subject dissimilarities (median (Q1-Q3): 0.68 (0.56-0.77) vs. 0.38 (0.35-0.52), two sided Mann-Whitney test p < 0.00001. The within-subject dissimilarities did not depend on sex, age, BMI, illness duration and a daily dose of escitalopram. No significant differences between taxa levels, at the studied time points, were observed when adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing procedures. Conclusions: We conclude that a six-week treatment in a psychiatric hospital setting resulted in increased alpha biodiversity in fecal microbiota, however its causal relationship with patients' mental health was not proved. We have also found that individual microbiome stability was not affected by hospitalization.","[Liskiewicz, Pawel; Pelka-Wysiecka, Justyna; Wronski, Michal; Baba-Kubis, Agata; Samochowiec, Jerzy] Pomeranian Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, Broniewskiego 26, PL-71460 Szczecin, Poland; [Kaczmarczyk, Mariusz] Pomeranian Med Univ, Dept Clin & Mol Biochem, PowstancOw Wielkopolskich 72, PL-70111 Szczecin, Poland; [Loniewski, Igor; Skonieczna-Zydecka, Karolina] Pomeranian Med Univ, Dept Biochem & Human Nutr, Broniewskiego 24, PL-71460 Szczecin, Poland; [Marlicz, Wojciech] Pomeranian Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Unii Lubelskiej 1, PL-71252 Szczecin, Poland; [Misiak, Blaiej] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Genet, Marcinkowskiego 1, PL-50368 Wroclaw, Poland",Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (Poland) [FSN-312-05/15],The study was funded within the framework of the project Fundusz Stymulacji Nauki (grant number: FSN-312-05/15) provided by Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (Poland).,0,FEB,2019,8,2,10.3390/jcm8020164,"Medicine, General & Internal"

Although MHC often can be assessed through olfactory cues, the mechanism by which MHC genes influence odour remains largely unclear. MHC class IIB molecules, which enable recognition and elimination of extracellular bacteria, have been suggested to influence odour indirectly by shaping odour-producing microbiota, i.e. bacterial communities. However, there is little evidence of the predicted covariation between an animal's MHC genotype and its bacterial communities in scent-producing body surfaces. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we tested the covariation between MHC class IIB genotypes and feather microbiota in the blue petrel (Halobaena caerulea), a seabird with highly developed olfaction that has been suggested to rely on oduor cues during an MHC-based mate choice. First, we show that individuals with similar MHC class IIB profiles also have similar bacterial assemblages in their feathers. Then, we show that individuals with high MHC diversity have less diverse feather microbiota and also a reduced abundance of a bacterium of the genus Arsenophonus, a genus in which some species are symbionts of avian ectoparasites. Our results, showing that feather microbiota covary with MHC, are consistent with the hypothesis that individual MHC genotype may shape the semiochemical-producing microbiota in birds.","[Leclaire, Sarah] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, ENFA, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol,UMR 5174, Toulouse, France; [Leclaire, Sarah; Dell'Ariccia, Gaia; Gabirot, Marianne; Bonadonna, Francesco] CNRS, CEFE, Montpellier, France; [Strandh, Maria; Westerdahl, Helena] Lund Univ, Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Lund, Sweden","Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor [354]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [10-LABX-41, 13-PDOC-0002]","Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor, Grant/Award Number: 354; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: 10-LABX-41 and 13-PDOC-0002",2,FEB,2019,28,4,10.1111/mec.14993,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology

ASD is, however, often associated with medical comorbidities and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is among the most common. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between GI dysfunction and the degree of social impairment in ASD. The etiology of GI abnormalities in ASD is unclear, though the association between GI dysfunction and ASD-associated behaviors suggest that overlapping developmental defects in the brain and the intestine and/or a defect in communication between the enteric and central nervous systems (ENS and CNS, respectively), known as the gut-brain axis, could be responsible for the observed phenotypes. Brain-gut abnormalities have been increasingly implicated in several disease processes, including ASD. As a critical modulator of ENS and CNS development and function, serotonin may be a nexus for the gut-brain axis in ASD. This paper reviews the role of serotonin in ASD from the perspective of the ENS. A murine model that has been demonstrated to possess brain, behavioral and GI abnormalities mimicking those seen in ASD harbors the most common serotonin transporter (SERT) based mutation (SERT Ala56) found in children with ASD. Discussion of the gut-brain manifestations in the SERT Ala56 mice, and their correction with developmental administration of a 5-HT4 agonist, are also addressed in conjunction with other future directions for diagnosis and treatment.","[Israelyan, Narek] Columbia Univ Vagelos Coll Phys & Surg, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Margolis, Kara Gross] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Morgan Stanley Childrens Hosp, 620 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [KO8DK093786]; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [PR160365]; Center for Discovery;  [NIAT35AG044303],"The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the following sources: NIH KO8DK093786 (KGM), The Department of Defense PR160365 (KGM), The Center for Discovery (KGM) and NIAT35AG044303 (NI).",2,FEB,2019,140,,10.1016/j.phrs.2018.12.023,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Stressors during this time may alter signaling from the gut microbiome, which has been shown to increase the risk for psychiatric disorders. It was hypothesized that adolescent stressors may potentiate the symptoms of anxiety and sensory abnormalities induced by a gut bacterial product, the short-chain fatty acid, propionic acid (PPA). The present study investigated the effects of repeated predator odor exposure during early adolescence on male rats administered PPA in late adolescence and adulthood on a behavioral test battery. Male adolescent Long-Evans rats were repeatedly exposed to a worn or unworn cat collar stimulus in early adolescence on postnatal days (P) 28, P30, P32, and P34. They were administered either PPA (500 mg/kg i.p.), or its vehicle in late adolescence on P40 and P43, and were subsequently tested on the light-dark anxiety task and acoustic startle task, respectively. In adulthood, the rats were again injected with PPA or its vehicle on P74 and P77, and subsequently tested on the light-dark apparatus and acoustic startle task, respectively. The repeated predator odor exposure was aversive and produced long-term anxiogenic effects as measured by the light-dark apparatus. PPA decreased activity and percent prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, with its effects on vertical activity, a putative measure of escape behavior, being potentiated by prior predator stress. PPA's effects in adulthood were diminished in comparison to adolescence. These results suggest the importance of evaluating the effects of early adolescent stress on subsequent environmental insults on the development of behavioral abnormalities.","[Wah, Deanne Tak On; Ossenkopp, Klaus-Peter; Kavaliers, Martin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada; [Ossenkopp, Klaus-Peter; Bishnoi, Indra; Kavaliers, Martin] Univ Western Ontario, Grad Program Neurosci, London, ON, Canada; [Kavaliers, Martin] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Kavaliers, Martin] Univ Guelph, Neurosci Program, Guelph, ON, Canada",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grants awarded to M.

The present review briefly summarizes the most common animal models that have been brought forward along with some of the associated pharmacological validation data. Like all preclinical models, these models have issues that need to be appreciated in the generation and interpretation of data for the purposes of translation to human disease; specifically, there are deficiencies in construct validity, a lack of medicines that effectively address residual fatigue symptoms, and difficulties in defining specificity with respect to drug effects on fatigue per se. Nonetheless, existing animal models of fatigue arguably serve the valuable purpose of encouraging research in this large area of unmet medical need.

We investigated associations between gut microbiota profiles and affective disorders by comparing monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant (affected twins with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission) and discordant to affective disorders (high-risk) with MZ twins without affective disorders (low-risk). Methods Stool samples were collected from 128 MZ twins and the microbiome was profiled using 16S rDNA sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Results Affected twins had a lower diversity and an absence of a specific operational taxonomical unit (OTU) in comparison with low-risk twins. The high-risk twins exhibited the same pattern although the lower diversity was only at a trend level. The OTU belonged to the family Christensenellaceae. The findings were not explained by lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, or psychotropic medication). Conclusion Affected twins in remission and high-risk twins presented aberrant gut microbiota with depletion of a specific OTU. If replicated, this reduced relative sequence absence may together with the globally altered microbiota composition act as a vulnerability marker by accentuating the effect of gene-environment interactions in individuals genetically disposed for an affective disorder.","[Vinberg, M.; Ottesen, N.

Finally, we found a significant difference in commensal microbes, including decreases in Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, in adult male offspring exposed to prenatal stress when compared to non-stressed controls.

Patients were divided into two groups, demented and non-demented. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the variables independently associated with dementia. The T-RFLP analysis revealed differences in the composition of the gut microbiome: the number of Bacteroides (enterotype I) was lower and the number of 'other' bacteria (enterotype III) was higher in demented than non-demented patients. Multivariable analyses showed that the populations of enterotype I and enterotype III bacteria were strongly associated with dementia, independent of the traditional dementia biomarkers.

Though not tested in human studies, recent primate studies indicate that the gut microbiome may also be a biological mechanism linking relationships to health. Integrating microbiota data into the 60-year-old Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we found that socialness with family and friends is associated with differences in the human fecal microbiota. Analysis of spouse (N = 94) and sibling pairs (N = 83) further revealed that spouses have more similar microbiota and more bacterial taxa in common than siblings, with no observed differences between sibling and unrelated pairs. These differences held even after accounting for dietary factors. The differences between unrelated individuals and married couples was driven entirely by couples who reported close relationships; there were no differences in similarity between couples reporting somewhat close relationships and unrelated individuals. Moreover, married individuals harbor microbial communities of greater diversity and richness relative to those living alone, with the greatest diversity among couples reporting close relationships, which is notable given decades of research documenting the health benefits of marriage. These results suggest that human interactions, especially sustained, close marital relationships, influence the gut microbiota.","[Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.; Kemis, Julia H.; Kerby, Robert L.; Sorenson, Thomas; Rey, Federico E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bacteriol, 1550 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.; Herd, Pamela] Ctr Demog Hlth & Aging, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Tang, Zheng-Zheng; Chen, Guanhua] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, 600 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53792 USA; [Tang, Zheng-Zheng] Wisconsin Inst Discovery, 330 N Orchard St, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Herd, Pamela] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 37th St NW,O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 2350 Hlth Sci Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Palloni, Alberto] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2016-67017-24416]; National Institutes for Aging, National Institutes for Health [AG041868]; Center for the Demography of Health and Aging [AG017266]; Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), National Institutes for Health National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000427]; U. of Wisconsin-Madison","The authors wish to thank members of the Rey laboratory for their insights and support.

Here, we use 16S rRNA sequencing to survey the gut bacteria of seven non-industrialized populations from Tanzania and Botswana. These include populations practicing traditional hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, and agropastoralist subsistence lifestyles and a comparative urban cohort from the greater Philadelphia region. Results: We find that bacterial diversity per individual and within-population phylogenetic dissimilarity differs between Botswanan and Tanzanian populations, with Tanzania generally having higher diversity per individual and lower dissimilarity between individuals. Among subsistence groups, the gut bacteria of hunter-gatherers are phylogenetically distinct from both agropastoralists and pastoralists, but that of agropastoralists and pastoralists were not significantly different from each other. Nearly half of the Bantu-speaking agropastoralists from Botswana have gut bacteria that are very similar to the Philadelphian cohort. Based on imputed metagenomic content, US samples have a relative enrichment of genes found in pathways for degradation of several common industrial pollutants. Within two African populations, we find evidence that bacterial composition correlates with the genetic relatedness between individuals. Conclusions: Across the cohort, similarity in bacterial presence/absence compositions between people increases with both geographic proximity and genetic relatedness, while abundance weighted bacterial composition varies more significantly with geographic proximity than with genetic relatedness.","[Hansen, Matthew E.

Several studies report a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in autistic individuals. Cumulative evidence reveals that the gut microbiota and its metabolites (especially short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs) play an important role in GI disorders and the pathogenesis of ASD. However, the composition of the gut microbiota and its association with fecal SCFAs and GI symptoms of autistic children remain largely unknown. In the present study, we sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, detected fecal SCFAs, assessed GI symptoms and analyzed the relationship between the gut microbiome and fecal SCFAs in autistic and neurotypical individuals. The results showed that the compositions of the gut microbiota and SCFAs were altered in ASD individuals. We found lower levels of fecal acetic acid and butyrate and a higher level of fecal valeric acid in ASD subjects. We identified decreased abundances of key butyrate-producing taxa (Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium, Lachnospiraceae and Erysipelotrichaceae) and an increased abundance of valeric acid associated bacteria (Acidobacteria) among autistic individuals. Constipation was the only GI disorder in ASD children in the present study. We also found enriched Fusobacterium, Barnesiella, Coprobacter and valeric acid-associated bacteria (Actinomycetaceae) and reduced butyrate-producing taxa in constipated autistic subjects. It is suggested that the gut microbiota contributes to fecal SCFAs and constipation in autism. Modulating the gut microbiota, especially butyrate-producing bacteria, could be a promising strategy in the search for alternatives for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.","[Liu, Simeng; Yu, Yong; Mei, Lu; Zheng, Pengyuan] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Affiliated Hosp 5, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Li, Enyao; Sun, Zhenyu; Jiang, Miaomiao; Tang, Youcai] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Children Rehabil Med, Affiliated Hosp 5, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Dongjun] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Duan, Guiqin] Zhengzhou Univ, Ctr Children Psychol & Behav, Affiliated Hosp 3, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Pingchang] McMaster Univ, Brain Body Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Tang, Youcai] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Pediat, Affiliated Hosp 5, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81370494, 31471330]; Special Scientific Research Fund of Public Welfare Profession of National Health and Family Planning Commission [201502026]",The authors gratefully acknowledge all the participants and their families.

However, whether the effect of L. reuteri on social behavior is generalizable to other ASD models and its mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Here, we found that treatment with L. reuteri selectively rescues social deficits in genetic, environmental, and idiopathic ASD models. Interestingly, the effects of L. reuteri on social behavior are not mediated by restoring the composition of the host's gut microbiome, which is altered in all of these ASD models. Instead, L. reuteri acts in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and rescues social interaction-induced synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area of ASD mice, but not in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice. Collectively, treatment with L. reuteri emerges as promising non-invasive microbial-based avenue to combat ASD-related social dysfunction.","[Sgritta, Martina; Dooling, Sean W.; Buffington, Shelly A.; Francis, Michael B.; Costa-Mattiolit, Mauro] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sgritta, Martina; Dooling, Sean W.; Buffington, Shelly A.; Francis, Michael B.; Costa-Mattiolit, Mauro] Baylor Coll Med, Memory & Brain Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Dooling, Sean W.; Costa-Mattiolit, Mauro] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Momin, Eric N.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosurg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Britton, Robert A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH112356]; Sammons Enterprise,"We thank Marina Grasso for administrative support; Sanjeev Khatiwada and Andon N.

This concept was later broadened to include postnatal events. It is clear that the interaction between genetic predisposition and early life environmental exposures is key in this regard. However, recent research has also identified another important factor in the microbiota-the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit key body niches, including the vagina and gastrointestinal tract. Because the composition of these maternal microbiome sites has been linked to maternal metabolism and is also vertically transmitted to offspring, changes in the maternal microbiota are poised to significantly affect the newborn. In fact, several lines of evidence show that the gut microbiota interacts with diet, drugs, and stress both prenatally and postnatally and that these exogenous factors could also affect the dynamic changes in the microbiota composition occurring during pregnancy. Animal models have shown great utility in illuminating how these disruptions result in behavioral and brain morphological phenotypes reminiscent of psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders). Increasing evidence points to critical interactions among the microbiota, host genetics, and both the prenatal and postnatal environments to temporally program susceptibility to psychiatric disorders later in life. Sex-specific phenotypes may be programmed through the influence of the microbiota on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neuroimmune system.","[Codagnone, Martin G.; Spichak, Simon; O'Mahony, Siobhain M.; O'Leary, Olivia F.; Clarke, Gerard; Stanton, Catherine; Dinan, Timothy G.; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Ireland, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland; [Codagnone, Martin G.; Spichak, Simon; O'Mahony, Siobhain M.; O'Leary, Olivia F.; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard; Stanton, Catherine] Univ Coll Cork, Irish Ctr Fetal & Neonatal Translat Res, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard; Stanton, Catherine] Univ Coll Cork, Cork Univ Matern Hosp, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland; [Stanton, Catherine] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Moorepk, Cork, Ireland",Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the Irish Government's National Development PlanScience Foundation Ireland; SFIScience Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2273],"The APC Microbiome Institute is funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the Irish Government's National Development Plan.

Understanding what underpins these differences is important, as high-diversity microbiotas associated with BV are implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and enhanced susceptibility to and transmission of sexually transmitted infections.Main textWe hypothesize that these variations in the vaginal microbiota can, in part, be explained by variations in the connectivity of sexual networks. We argue: 1) Couple-level data suggest that BV-associated bacteria can be sexually transmitted and hence high sexual network connectivity would be expected to promote the spread of BV-associated bacteria. Epidemiological studies have found positive associations between indicators of network connectivity and the prevalence of BV; 2) The relationship between BV prevalence and STI incidence/prevalence can be parsimoniously explained by differential network connectivity; 3) Studies from other mammals are generally supportive of the association between network connectivity and high-diversity vaginal microbiota.ConclusionTo test this hypothesis, we propose a combination of empirical and simulation-based study designs.","[Kenyon, Chris R.] Inst Trop Med, STI Unit, Natl Str 155, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Delva, Wim] South African DST NRF Ctr Excellence Epidemiol Mo, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Delva, Wim] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Global Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Delva, Wim] Univ Ghent, Int Ctr Reprod Hlth, Ghent, Belgium; [Delva, Wim] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Delva, Wim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Rega Inst Med Res, Leuven, Belgium; [Brotman, Rebecca M.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Inst Genome Sci, Ghent, Belgium",NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI116799],,1,Jan-10,2019,19,,10.1186/s12905-018-0703-0,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Obstetrics & Gynecology"

The severity of these symptoms has been correlated with the degree of GI microbial dysbiosis. The study objective was to assess tolerability of a probiotic (Bifidobacterium infantis) in combination with a bovine colostrum product (BCP) as a source of prebiotic oligosaccharides and to evaluate GI, microbiome and immune factors in children with ASD and GI co-morbidities. This pilot study is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial of combination treatment (BCP + B. infantis) vs. BCP alone in a cross-over study in children ages 2-11 with ASD and GI co-morbidities (n = 8). This 12-week study included 5 weeks of probiotic-prebiotic supplementation, followed by a two-week washout period, and 5 weeks of prebiotic only supplementation. The primary outcome of tolerability was assessed using validated questionnaires of GI function and atypical behaviors, along with side effects. Results suggest that the combination treatment is well-tolerated in this cohort. The most common side effect was mild gassiness. Some participants on both treatments saw a reduction in the frequency of certain GI symptoms, as well as reduced occurrence of particular aberrant behaviors. Improvement may be explained by a reduction in IL-13 and TNF-alpha production in some participants. Although limited conclusions can be drawn from this small pilot study, the results support the need for further research into the efficacy of these treatments.","[Sanctuary, Megan R.; Slupsky, Carolyn M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Nutr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kain, Jennifer N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Chen, Shin Yu; Kalanetra, Karen; German, J.

The second is the biomedical delineation of the environment of reproduction and development as an object of growing research and intervention, as well as the marking off of early-life environments as an ""exposed biology"" consequential to the entire life span.

Therefore, researchers also look for the alternative approaches to its treatment. It is suggested that changes in human gut microbiome mediated by exercise could influence the development and progression of AD and a new term ""muscle-gut-brain axis"" is introduced. There is much evidence to support this assumption. The gut microbiology is closely related to a wide range of diseases of the nervous system and therefore any negative qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition of the gut microbiota can potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of AD. Research shows that the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis with probiotics/synbiotics/eubiotics can prevent or alleviate the symptoms of these chronic neurological diseases. Studies also point to the positive effects of movement on the health of seniors. A positive correlation can be found between cognitive functions and physical stress, both in the elderly and in AD patients. Even short-term interventions with a relatively low frequency seem to produce positive results, while physical activities can be performed by using relatively simple and cost-effective means. In addition, physical activity can significantly modulate gut microbiome. Thus, it can be concluded that physical activity in humans seems to correlate with gut microbiome, which can prevent the incidence and development of AD.","[Schlegel, Petr] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Educ, Dept Phys Educ & Sports, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Novotny, Michal] Univ Hosp Hradec Kralove, Biomed Res Ctr, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Novotny, Michal; Klimova, Blanka; Valis, Martin] Univ Hosp Hradec Kralove, Dept Neurol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Klimova, Blanka] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Appl Linguist, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic","MH CZ -DRO (UHHK) [00179906]; Ministry of Health of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Health, Czech Republic [FN HK66400179906]; Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic (PROGRES Q40); project IT4Neuro (degeneration) [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/18_069/0010054]; SPEV project [2104/2019]","This work was supported by MH CZ -DRO (UHHK, 00179906) - by the grant projects of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (FN HK66400179906) and of the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic (PROGRES Q40), by the project IT4Neuro (degeneration), reg. no.

Objective and Methods: The aim of this review is to provide a discussion of the translational evidence about Early Onset OCD (EO) in compliance with a neurodevelopmental and RdoC perspective. Results and Conclusion: EO might be considered the neurodevelopmental subtype of OCD. Indeed there is evidence that different clusters of symptoms and dimensions at an early stage predict different trajectories in phenotype and that distinct neurocircuit pathways underpin the progression of the disorder. Despite the development of high refractoriness in the course of the disorder, evidence suggests that EO may be particularly treatment responsive in the early stages, thus showing the need for early recognition and additional recovery oriented studies in this subgroup. Consistent with the neurodevelopmental perspective, immunity and glutamate neurotransmission are emerging as novel pathways for parsing out the neurobiology of OCD, the EO form, in particular, supporting the implementation of new multisystemic models of the OCD phenotype. Brain connectivity patterns, immune and mierobiome profiles are standing out as promising areas for biomarkers with the potential for targeted personalized therapies in EO.","[Burchi, Elisabetta; Pallanti, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Sci Salute, Florence, Italy; [Burchi, Elisabetta] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 111 East 210th St, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Pallanti, Stefano] Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pallanti, Stefano] Inst Neurosci, Florence, Italy",,,0,,2019,17,8,10.2174/1570159X16666180426151746,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Knowledge of this information is vital for social workers so that the impact of their interventions can be maximized.

However, little is known about the role of food and diet from the perspectives of pediatric patients and their parents. This study aimed to explore how children and adolescents with IBD and their parents coped with the illness through food and diet in their daily lives. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 children and adolescents with IBD, 26 parents and one grandparent. Results: Two major themes, dietary strategies and family food practices, were identified through thematic analysis. There were three types of dietary strategies: food avoidance and moderation; following a specific diet; and healthy eating. For family food practices, two subthemes were identified: impact on grocery shopping, meal planning, and cooking; and maintaining routine and normality. Conclusions: Our findings have important implications for the clinical care of pediatric IBD. Notably, IBD not only influenced the food practices of the pediatric patients, but also their parents and other family members. Healthcare professionals should consider the family unit when giving nutritional advice or developing nutritional guidelines. Personalized nutritional counselling and ongoing nutritional assessment are also warranted.","[Chuong, Kim H.; Haw, Jennie; O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Stintzi, Alain] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Inst Syst Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Stintzi, Alain] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Immunol, Fac Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mack, David R.] Univ Ottawa, CHEO, IBD Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mack, David R.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Pediat, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Crohn's and Colitis Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [ECD-144627],This work was supported by funding from Crohn's and Colitis Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research [grant number ECD-144627].,0,Jan-01,2019,14,1,10.1080/17482631.2019.1648945,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing; Social Sciences, Biomedical"

The 'anorexia of ageing' is the age-related appetite and weight loss underpinning such undernutrition. This review examines the latest evidence for its prevention and treatment. Recent findings Existing nutritional therapies for the anorexia of ageing include supporting nutritional intake with fortified food or supplements, including protein, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, and vitamin D. The Mediterranean diet provides high fat intake and nutrient density in a moderate volume of colourful and flavoursome food and is strengthening in evidence for healthy ageing. Studies of the gut microbiome, which potentially regulates normal appetite by acting on the brain-gut communication axis, are pertinent. Utilisation of the genetic profile of individuals to determine nutritional needs is an exciting advancement of the past decade and may become common practice. Summary Prevention or early treatment of the anorexia of ageing in older adults is critical. Latest evidence suggests that once significant weight loss has occurred, aggressive nutritional support may not result in improved outcomes.","[Dent, Elsa] Torrens Univ Australia, Level 1,220 Victoria Sq, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Dent, Elsa] Baker Heart & Diabet Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dent, Elsa; Wright, Olivia R.

The complex and widespread influence of the microbiome on many physiological and psychological processes has generated a keen interest in its therapeutic potential for depression, anxiety, autism, and other psychiatric disorders. It has been shown that the microbiome composition of people suffering with such conditions differs significantly from that of healthy controls, and although the area is in its infancy, interventional studies that alter a person's microbiome through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or dietary change can alleviate psychopathological symptoms.","[Butler, Mary I.; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland; [Butler, Mary I.; Cryan, John F.; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Ireland, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland",,,2,,2019,15,,10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718-095432,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology"

The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain. Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome. Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research.","[Bastiaanssen, Thomaz F. S.; Cowan, Caitlin S.

Here, we assess relationships between self-reported measures of depression, perceived stress, social support, and food insecurity with diet quality in older adults with HIV. A retrospective analysis of self-reported data from parent study at The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1917 HIV Clinic was performed. The study sample consisted of sixty people living with HIV (PLWH) with controlled HIV infection (<50 copies/mL), aged 50 years or older who participated in a cross-sectional microbiome study. Dietary intake was measured using the NHANES 12-month Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and three Automated Self-Administered (ASA) 24-hr diet recalls to calculate diet quality scores using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS); alternative Healthy Eating Index (aHEI); and the Recommended Food Score (RFS) indices. Food insecurity was measured with the Food Security Questionnaire (FSQ). Participants completed the following psychosocial scales: (1) depression- Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ8); (2) perceived stress - Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10); (3) social support- Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Linear regression models were used to investigate relationships among variables controlling for gender and income. The cohort was characterized as follows: Mean age 56 +/- 4.6 years, 80% African-American, and 32% women. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.4 +/- 7.2 with 55% reporting food insecurity. Most participants reported having post-secondary education (53%), although 77% reported annual incomes <$20,000. Food insecurity was independently associated with measures of poor dietary intake: aHEI (=-0.08, p=.02) and MDS (=-0.23, p<0.01) and with low dietary intake of fibre (=-0.27, p=.04), vitamin E (=-0.35, p=.01), folate (=-0.31, p=.02), magnesium (=-0.34, p=.01) and copper (=-0.36, p=.01).

Although exposure-based therapy is currently the gold-standard treatment, many people either do not respond to this therapy or experience a relapse of symptoms after treatment has ceased. In recent years, there have been many novel pharmacological agents identified in preclinical research that have potential as adjuncts for exposure therapy, yet very few of these are regularly integrated into clinical practice. Unfortunately, the robust effects observed in the laboratory animal often do not translate to a clinical population. In this review, we discuss how age, sex, genetics, stress, medications, diet, alcohol, and the microbiome can vary across a clinical population and yet are rarely considered in drug development. While not an exhaustive list, we have focused on these factors because they have been shown to influence an individual's vulnerability to anxiety and alter the neurotransmitter systems often targeted by pharmacological adjuncts to therapy. We argue that for potential adjuncts to be successfully translated from the lab to the clinic empirical research must be broadened to consider how individual difference factors will influence drug efficacy.","[King, Gabrielle; Baker, Kathryn D.; Bisby, Madelyne A.; Chan, Diana; Stylianakis, Anthea A.; Zimmermann, Kelsey S.; Richardson, Rick] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Cowan, Caitlin S.

Prebiotics can inhibit the growth of these pathogenic microbes by nourishing beneficial bacteria, while probiotics--live microorganisms--can balance the gut bacteria: thus, both together can maintain healthy bacteria in the gut. The present study was conducted to find the effect of probiotics and prebiotics in balancing the gut flora in a rodent model of autism linked with a clindamycin-induced altered gut. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on oxidative stress markers in the brain were also evaluated. Eight groups of hamsters were assigned, with Group I serving as the control; Group II, as the autistic model, was treated with 250 mg propionic acid/kg BW/day for 3 days; Group III was treated with clindamycin 30 mg/kg BW for 3 days; Groups IV and V were treated with bee pollen and propolis (supposed prebiotics) at a dose of 250 mg/kg BW/day for 28 days; Group VI and Group VII were treated with Lactobacillus paracaseii and Protexin (R) (supposed probiotics) for 28 days; and finally, Group VIII was anorectally transplanted with stool from normal animals for 5 days. Remarkable changes were measured in oxidative stress markers, primarily glutathione and vitamin C, in the brains of hamsters in the propionic acid- and clindamycin-treated group. All probiotic/prebiotic treatments showed ameliorative effects; however, lactobacillus had the strongest effect. We conclude that pro-and prebiotic supplements may be effective to revive healthy digestive system function in autistic patients. The disappointing results of the fecal transplants suggest that further study is needed to develop an appropriate technique.","[Aabed, Kawther; Al-Qahtani, Alaa] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Biol Dept, Coll Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Bhat, Ramesa Shafi] King Saud Univ, Biochem Dept, Coll Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Moubayed, Nadine] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Bot & Microbiol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Mutiri, Manar; Al-Marshoud, Majda; El-Ansary, Afaf] King Saud Univ, Cent Lab, Female Ctr Sci & Med Studies, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [El-Ansary, Afaf] Natl Res Ctr, Therapuet Chem Dept, Cairo, Egypt","Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman [38-213]","This research project was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman, Grant number 38-213.",0,,2019,65,1,10.14715/cmb/2019.65.1.1,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology

Microglial dysfunction has been implicated in the onset and progression of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases; however, the multitude of factors and signals influencing microglial activity have not been fully elucidated. Microglia not only respond to local signals within the brain but also receive input from the periphery, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Recent preclinical findings suggest that the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in regulating microglial maturation and function, and altered microbial community composition has been reported in neurological disorders with known microglial involvement in humans. Collectively, these findings suggest that bidirectional crosstalk between the gut and the brain may influence disease pathogenesis. Herein, we discuss recent studies showing a role for the gut microbiome in modulating microglial development and function in homeostatic and disease conditions and highlight possible future research to develop novel microbial treatments for disorders of the brain.","[Abdel-Haq, Reem; Mazmanian, Sarkis K.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Schlachetzki, Johannes C.

Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched for articles published in English in the last 10 years with the concepts of the microbiome, probiotics, and PEC, PTB, or GDM. Forty-nine articles were eligible for full-text review. Five articles were excluded, leaving 44 articles that met all the eligibility criteria. The relationships between the microbiome and the risk for PEC, PTB, and GDM are not fully elucidated, although probiotic interventions seem beneficial in decreasing PEC and GDM risk. Probiotic interventions targeting bacterial vaginosis and elimination of infection in women at risk for PTB appear to be beneficial.

Obesity is a multifactorial disorder in which various elements (genetic, host, and environment), play a definite role, even if none of them satisfactorily explains its etiology. A number of neurological comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression, charges the global obesity burden, and evidence suggests the hypothesis that the brain could be the seat of the initial malfunction leading to obesity. The gut microbiome plays an important role in energy homeostasis regulating energy harvesting, fat deposition, as well as feeding behavior and appetite. Dietary patterns, like the Western diet, are known to be a major cause of the obesity epidemic, probably promoting a dysbiotic drift in the gut microbiota. Moreover, the existence of a ""gut-brain axis"" suggests a role for microbiome on hosts' behavior according to different modalities, including interaction through the nervous system, and mutual crosstalk with the immune and the endocrine systems.

In this study, 1672 healthy volunteers from twin registry TwinsUK had data available for at least one socioeconomic measure, existing fecal 16S rRNA microbiota data, and all considered co-variables. Associations with socioeconomic status (SES) were robust to adjustment for known health correlates of the microbiome; conversely, these health-microbiome associations partially attenuated with adjustment for SES. Twins discordant for IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation) were shown to significantly differ by measures of compositional dissimilarity, with suggestion the greater the difference in twin pair IMD, the greater the dissimilarity of their microbiota.

First, stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second, stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third, stress triggers physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reward processing in the brain, and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally, stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes, ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.","[Tomiyama, A.

Measurements and Main Results: Five phenotypes were identified and mainly differentiated by patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization (low wheeze/low atopy; low wheeze/high atopy; transient wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/high atopy). Asthma was most often present in the high-wheeze phenotypes, with greatest respiratory morbidity among children with frequent wheezing and allergic sensitization. These phenotypes differentially related to early-life exposures, including maternal stress and depression, antenatal environmental tobacco smoke, house dust microbiome, and allergen content (all P<0.05). Prenatal smoke exposure, maternal stress, and depression were highest in the high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype. The high-wheeze/high-atopy phenotype was associated with low household microbial richness and diversity. Early-life aeroallergen exposure was low in high-wheeze phenotypes. Conclusions: Patterns of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and lung function identified five respiratory phenotypes among inner-city children. Early-life environmental exposure to stress, depression, tobacco smoke, and indoor allergens and microbes differentially associate with specific phenotypes.","[Bacharier, Leonard B.; Beigelman, Avraham] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 425 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bacharier, Leonard B.; Beigelman, Avraham] St Louis Childrens Hosp, St Louis, MO 63178 USA; [Calatroni, Agustin; Visness, Cynthia M.] Rho Fed Syst Div Inc, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jackson, Daniel J.; Gern, James E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, Madison, WI USA; [Gergen, Peter J.] NIAID, Rockville, MD USA; [O'Connor, George T.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Sandel, Megan T.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Kattan, Meyer] Columbia Univ, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wood, Robert A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Lynch, Susan V.; Fujimura, Kei E.; Fadrosh, Douglas W.; Santee, Clark A.; Boushey, Homer] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA USA","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [NO1-AI-25496, NO1-AI-25482, HHSN272200900052C, HHSN272201000052I, 1 UM1AI114271-01, UM2AI117870]; National Center for Research Resources, NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR00052, M01RR00533, 1 UL1RR025771, M01RR00071, 1 UL1RR024156, 5 UL1RR024992-02]; National Center for the Advancement of Translational Research, NIH [UL1TR001079, UL1TR000040]","Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH (contract numbers NO1-AI-25496, NO1-AI-25482, HHSN272200900052C, HHSN272201000052I, 1 UM1AI114271-01, and UM2AI117870).

Limited data obtained in human beings suggest that alterations in these interactions may play a role in several brain gut disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the preclinical and clinical literature related to the topic of brain gut microbiome interactions. RESULTS: Well-characterized bidirectional communication channels, involving neural, endocrine, and inflammatory mechanisms, exist between the gut and the brain. Communication through these channels may be modulated by variations in the permeability of the intestinal wall and the blood-brain barrier. Brain gut microbiome interactions are programmed during the first 3 years of life, including the prenatal period, but can be modulated by diet, medications, and stress throughout life. Based on correlational studies, alterations in these interactions have been implicated in the regulation of food intake, obesity, and in irritable bowel syndrome, even though causality remains to be established. CONCLUSIONS: Targets within the brain gut microbiome axis have the potential to become targets for novel drug development for brain gut disorders.","[Osadchiy, Vadim; Martin, Clair R.; Mayer, Emeran A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Vatche & Tamar Manoukian Div Digest Dis, G Oppenheimer Ctr Neurobiol Stress & Resilience, CHS 42-210,MC737818,10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [DK048351, DK064539, DK096606]","Supported by grants DK048351, DK064539, and DK096606 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (E.A.M.).",5,JAN,2019,17,2,10.1016/j.cgh.2018.10.002,Gastroenterology & Hepatology

Emerging rodent research suggests that the gut microbiome may be a key mediator in the association between early life stress and dysregulated glucocorticoid-immune response. However, ACE impact on inflammatory response to stress, or on the gut microbiome, have not been studied in human pregnancy, when inflammation increases risk of poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships among ACE, the gut microbiome, and cytokine response to stress in pregnant women. Methods: Physically and psychiatrically healthy adult pregnant women completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACE-Q) and gave a single stool sample between 20 and 26 weeks gestation. Stool DNA was isolated and 16S sequencing was performed. Three 24-hour food recalls were administered to assess dietary nutrient intake. A subset of women completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) at 22-34 weeks gestation; plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and cortisol were measured at four timepoints pre and post stressor, and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: Forty-eight women completed the ACE-Q and provided stool; 19 women completed the TSST. Women reporting 2 or more ACEs (high ACE) had greater differential abundance of gut Prevotella than low ACE participants (q = 5.7 x 10<^> - 13). Abundance of several gut taxa were significantly associated with cortisol, IL-6, TNF-alpha and CRP AUCs regardless of ACE status. IL-6 response to stress was buffered among high ACE women with high intake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (p = 0.03) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (p = 0.05). Discussion: Our findings suggest that multiple childhood adversities are associated with changes in gut micro biota composition during pregnancy, and such changes may contribute to altered inflammatory and glucocorticoid response to stress. While preliminary, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between gut microbiota and acute glucocorticoid-immune response to stress in a clinical sample. Finally, exploratory analyses suggested that high ACE women with high dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had a dampened inflammatory response to acute stress, suggesting potentially protective effects of omega-3s in this high risk population. Given the adverse effects of inflammation on pregnancy and the developing fetus, mechanisms by which childhood adversity influence the gut-brain axis and potential protective factors such as diet should be further explored.","[Hantsoo, Liisa; Criniti, Stephanie; McGeehan, Brendan; Epperson, C.

However, for free ranging primates, little information is available for how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry forests undergo seasonally specific decreases in food abundance and water availability, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Sector Santa Rosa, Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity, composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome. Additionally, microbial fluctuations are likely contributing to nutrient uptake and the health of wild primate populations.","[Orkin, Joseph D.; Myers, Monica S.; Cheves Hernandez, Saul E.; Melin, Amanda D.] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Orkin, Joseph D.; Melin, Amanda D.] Univ Calgary, Alberta Childrens Hosp Res Inst, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Orkin, Joseph D.; Melin, Amanda D.] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Campos, Fernando A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Anthropol, San Antonio, TX USA; [Campos, Fernando A.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Guadamuz, Adrian] Area Conservac Guanacaste, Guanacaste, Costa Rica",Eppley Foundation for Research; International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability (I-CARES); Washington University in St. Louis; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI); BioProject [PRJNA485217],"For assistance and advice, we thank Guatam Dantas, Mrinalini Watsa, Matt Workentine, PJ Perry, Emily Davenport, Urs Kalbitzer, Jeremy Hogan, Xiaoqing Sun, and Emily Walco.

Consistently, qualitative and quantitative alteration of bacterial metabolites may functionally affect ASD pathophysiology. Up to date, age-restricted cohort studies, that may potentially help to identify specific microbial signatures in ASD, are lacking. We investigated the gut microbiota (GM) structure and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in a cohort of young children (2-4 years of age) with ASD, with respect to age-matched neurotypical healthy controls. Strong increase of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decrease of Actinobacteria was observed in these patients. Among the 91 OTUs whose relative abundance was altered in ASD patients, we observed a striking depletion of Bifidobacterium longum, one of the dominant bacteria in infant GM and, conversely, an increase of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a late colonizer of healthy human gut and a major butyrate producer. High levels of F prausnitzii were associated to increase of fecal butyrate levels within normal range, and over representation of KEGG functions related to butyrate production in ASD patients. Here we report unbalance of GM structure with a shift in colonization by gut beneficial bacterial species in ASD patients as off early childhood.","[Coretti, Lorena; Amato, Felice; Cuomo, Mariella; Natale, Alessandro; Comegna, Marika; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Chiariotti, Lorenzo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Mol Med & Med Biotechnol, Naples, Italy; [Coretti, Lorena] Univ Malta, Dept Physiol & Biochem, Fac Med & Surg, Msida, Malta; [Coretti, Lorena; Borrelli, Luca; Buommino, Elisabetta; Chiariotti, Lorenzo; Canani, Roberto Berni; Lembo, Francesca] Univ Naples Federico II, Task Force Microbiome Studies, Naples, Italy; [Paparo, Lorela; Riccio, Maria Pia; Corrado, Giusi; Bravaccio, Carmela; Canani, Roberto Berni] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Translat Med Sci, Pediat Sect, Naples, Italy; [Amato, Felice; Comegna, Marika; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Canani, Roberto Berni] Univ Naples Federico II, CEINGE Adv Biotechnol, Naples, Italy; [Borrelli, Luca] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Vet Med & Anim Prod, Naples, Italy; [Buommino, Elisabetta; Lembo, Francesca] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Pharm, Naples, Italy; [Chiariotti, Lorenzo] Ist Endocrinol & Oncol Sperimantale, Naples, Italy; [Canani, Roberto Berni] Univ Naples Federico II, European Lab Invest Food Induced Dis, Naples, Italy",,,5,Dec-19,2018,9,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03146,Microbiology

Mangroves play an important role in carbon storage, nutrient cycling and support for the marine food web. Mangrove soils are formed by fine particles rich in organic carbon and are subject to constant fluctuations in oxygen, salinity and nutrient availability due to fresh water flux and tidal variations. Microbes play an important role in nutrient cycling in mangrove soils; however, studies on the mangrove soil microbiome are scarce. Here we compare the microbiome of pristine mangrove soil located in an environmentally protected area in Guaratuba, Southern Brazil, with the microbiome of mangrove soil affected by the presence of carbonaceaous debris eroding from an archeological site known as Sambaqui. We show that although the Sambaqui site has a major effect on soil chemistry, increasing the soil pH by 2.6 units, only minor changes in the soil microbiome were detected indicating resilience of the microbial community to pH variations. The high alpha diversity indexes and predicted metabolic potential suggest that the mangrove soil microbiome not only provides important ecological services but also may host a broad range of microbes and genes of biotechnological interest.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether associations exist between body mass index, physical activity, screen time, dietary consumption (fat, protein, carbohydrates, and fiber), and gut microbial diversity during the first year of college. Racially/ethnically diverse college students (n=82; 61.0% non-white) at a large Southwestern university completed self-reported physical activity and 24-h recall dietary assessments, height and weight measurements, and provided one fecal sample for gut microbiome analysis. Fecal microbial community composition was assessed with Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes. Post-hoc analyses compared microbial diversity by groups of high and low physical activity and fiber intake using QIIME and LEfSe bioinformatics software.ResultsNo statistically significant differences were observed between body mass index and gut microbiome abundance and diversity. Median daily consumption of dietary fiber was 11.2 (7.6, 14.9) g/d, while the median self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 55.7 (27.9, 79.3) min/d and screen time 195.0 (195.0, 315.0) min/d. Microbial analysis by LEfSe identified Paraprevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Lachnospira as important phylotypes in college students reporting greater MVPA, while Enterobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriales were more enriched among students reporting less MVPA (p<0.05). Barnesiellaceae, Alphaproteobacteria, and Ruminococcus were more abundant taxa among those consuming less than the median fiber intake (p<0.05). Post-hoc analyses comparing weighted UniFrac distance metrics based on combined categories of high and low MVPA and fiber revealed that clustering distances between members of the high MVPA-low fiber group were significantly smaller when compared to distances between members of all other MVPA-fiber groups (p<0.0001).ConclusionsHabitual fiber consumption and MVPA behaviors help explain the differential abundance of specific microbial taxa and overall gut microbial diversity differences in first-year college students.","[Whisner, Corrie M.; Dente, Brandon; Bruening, Meg] Arizona State Univ, Coll Hlth Solut, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Whisner, Corrie M.; Maldonado, Juan; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, Ctr Fundamental & Appl Microbi, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Maldonado, Juan] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, ASU Genom Core, Tempe, AZ USA; [Maldonado, Juan; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, Swette Ctr Environm Biotechnol, Tempe, AZ USA; [Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Fulton Sch Engn, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ USA","NIH Common Fund from the Office of the Director [1DP5OD017910]; NIH Common Fund from the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research [1DP5OD017910]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R01DK090379, R01DK105829]","This study was supported by the NIH Common Fund from the Office of the Director and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, grant number 1DP5OD017910 (PI: M.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients suffer from gastrointestinal problems and experience changes in gut microbiota; however, it is not yet clear whether the change in the microbiota associated with ASD is a cause or a consequence of the disease.MethodsWe have investigated the species richness and microbial composition in a valproic acid (VPA)-induced rat model autism. Fecal samples from the rectum were collected at necropsy, microbial total DNA was extracted, 16 rRNA genes sequenced using Illumina, and the global microbial co-occurrence network was constructed using a random matrix theory-based pipeline. Collected rat microbiome data were compared to available data derived from cases of autism.ResultsWe found that VPA administration during pregnancy reduced fecal microbial richness, changed the gut microbial composition, and altered the metabolite potential of the fecal microbial community in a pattern similar to that seen in patients with ASD. However, the global network property and network composition as well as microbial co-occurrence patterns were largely preserved in the offspring of rats exposed to prenatal administration of VPA.ConclusionsOur data on the microbiota of the VPA rat model of autism indicate that this model, in addition to behaviorally and anatomically mimicking the autistic brain as previously shown, also mimics the microbiome features of autism, making it one of the best-suited rodent models for the study of autism and ASD.","[Liu, Fang] Ocean Univ China, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Horton-Sparks, Kayla; Hull, Vanessa; Martinez-Cerdeno, Veronica] Inst Pediat Regenerat Med, 2504 Stockton Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Horton-Sparks, Kayla; Hull, Vanessa; Martinez-Cerdeno, Veronica] Shriners Hosp Children Northern Calif, 2504 Stockton Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Li, Robert W.] USDA ARS, Anim Genom & Improvement Lab, Beltsville, MD USA; [Martinez-Cerdeno, Veronica] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Sacramento, CA USA; [Martinez-Cerdeno, Veronica] MIND Inst, Sacramento, CA USA",National Institute for Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH094681]; Shriners Hospitals,This work was supported by the National Institute for Mental Health (MH094681) and the Shriners Hospitals.,4,Dec-10,2018,9,,10.1186/s13229-018-0251-3,Genetics & Heredity; Neurosciences

Micro-organisms together with their genetic information and the milieu in which they interact are called the microbiome. Studies have shown that the presence of certain microbiota during assisted reproductive technology (ART) has a positive impact on the outcome. However, the potential role of using the microbiome as a predictor for outcome of ART has not yet been investigated.MethodsIn a prospective study, 300 women of reproductive age and with an indication for in-vitro Fertilization (IVF) with or without Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) treatment will be included. Prior to the IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment, these women provided a midstream urine sample and a vaginal swab. The composition of the urinary and vaginal microbiome will be analysed with both Next Generation Sequencing and the IS-pro technique. The endpoints of the study are pregnancy achieved after fresh embryo transfer (ET) and within the subsequent year after inclusion. External validation of the findings will take place in an additional cohort of 50 women with an IVF or IVF-ICSI indication.DiscussionIn the proposed study, the predictive accuracy of the composition of the urinary and vaginal microbiome for IVF or IVF-ICSI outcome will be only validated for fresh ET. Follow-up has to show whether the predictive accuracy will be similar during the consecutive frozen ET's as part of the IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment or for subsequent stimulated or natural cycles. In addition, external validation will take place in another cohort and hospital.

Numerous studies have suggested that the incidence of insomnia and depressive disorder are linked to biological rhythms, immune function, and nutrient metabolism, but the exact mechanism is not yet clear. There is considerable evidence showing that the gut microbiome not only affects the digestive, metabolic, and immune functions of the host but also regulates host sleep and mental states through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Preliminary evidence indicates that microorganisms and circadian genes can interact with each other. The characteristics of the gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolism are related to the host's sleep and circadian rhythm. Moreover, emotion and physiological stress can also affect the composition of the gut microorganisms. The gut microbiome and inflammation may be linked to sleep loss, circadian misalignment, affective disorders, and metabolic disease. In this review article, we discuss various functions of the gut microbiome and how its activities interact with the circadian rhythms and emotions of the host. Exploring the effects of the gut microbiome on insomnia and depression will help further our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders. It is therefore important to regulate and maintain a normal gastrointestinal micro-ecological environment in patients when treating mental disorders.","[Li, Yuanyuan; Fan, Fang] South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Key Lab Mental Hlth & Cognit Sci Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuanyuan; Fan, Fang] South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yanli] Guangzhou Med Univ, Dept Anat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin] Southern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31871129, 31671165]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province [2017KZ010101]; Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme, GDUPS; Science and Technology Project Item in Guangdong Provincial Social Development Area [2014A020212563]; Priority subject fund from Bureau of Education of Guangzhou [2019KC206]; Major Research Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences Key Base of the Ministry of Education [16JJD190001]","The present study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31871129, 31671165), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2017KZ010101), Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme, GDUPS (2016), the Science and Technology Project Item in Guangdong Provincial Social Development Area (Grant No. 2014A020212563), Priority subject fund from Bureau of Education of Guangzhou (Grant No. 2019KC206), and Major Research Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences Key Base of the Ministry of Education (Grant No. 16JJD190001).",4,Dec-05,2018,9,,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00669,Psychiatry

Recently the gut microbiome has been identified as a new territory to explore in relation to cognition. Experiments using rodents have identified a link between the gut microbiome and cognitive function, particularly that low microbial diversity leads to poor cognition function. Similar studies in humans could identify novel targets to encourage healthy cognition in an aging population. Here, we investigate the association of gut microbiota and cognitive function in a human cohort considering the influence of physical frailty. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequence data, derived from fecal samples obtained from 1,551 individuals over the age of 40. Cognitive data was collected using four cognitive tests: verbal fluency (n = 1,368), Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Test (DLRT; n = 873), Mini Mental State Examination (recall; n = 1,374) and Paired Associates Learning from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB-PAL; n = 405). We use mixed effects models to identify associations with alpha diversity, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxa and performed further analyses adjusting for physical frailty. We then repeated the analyses in a subset of individuals with dietary data, also excluding those using medications shown to influence gut microbiome composition. DLRT and verbal fluency were negatively associated with alpha diversity of the gut microbiota (False-Discovery Rate, FDR, p < 0.05). However, when considering frailty as a covariate, only associations between the DLRT and diversity measures remained. Repeating analyses excluding Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and antibiotic users and accounting for diet, we similarly observe significant negative associations between the DLRT and alpha diversity measures and a further negative association between DLRT and the abundance of the order Burkholderiales that remains significant after adjusting for host frailty. This highlights the importance of considering concurrent differences in physical health in studies of cognitive performance and suggests that physical health has a relatively larger association with the gut microbiome. However, the frailty independent cognitive-gut microbiota associations that were observed might represent important targets for further research, with potential for use in diagnostic surveillance in cognitive aging and interventions to improve vitality.","[Verdi, Serena; Jackson, Matthew A.; Beaumont, Michelle; Bowyer, Ruth C.

The current study aims to identify whether socioeconomic status, sexual risk behavior and sexual healthcare seeking behavior may explain differences in CT seroprevalence between ethnic groups.MethodsWe used 2011-2014 baseline data of the HELIUS (HEalthy LIfe in an Urban Setting) study, a multi-ethnic population-based cohort study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, including participants from Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Ghanaian, Moroccan and Turkish origin. For this analysis, we selected sexually active, heterosexual participants aged 18-34years old. CT seroprevalence was determined using a multiplex serology assay. The CT seroprevalence ratios between different ethnicities are calculated and adjusted for potential indicators of socioeconomic status, sexual risk behavior and sexual healthcare seeking behavior.ResultsThe study population consisted of 2001 individuals (52.8% female) with a median age of 28years (IQR 24-31). CT seropositivity differed by ethnicities and ranged from 71.6% (African Surinamese), and 67.9% (Ghanaian) to 31.1% (Turkish). The CT seroprevalence ratio of African Surinamese was 1.72 (95% CI 1.43-2.06) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.16-1.99) of Ghanaian as compared to the Dutch reference group, after adjustment for socioeconomic status, sexual risk behavior and sexual healthcare seeking behavior.ConclusionsIndicators of socioeconomic status, sexual risk behavior, and sexual health seeking behavior could not explain the higher CT seroprevalence among African Surinamese and Ghanaian residents of Amsterdam.","[Hulstein, Sebastiaan H.; Matser, Amy; Alberts, Catharina J.; Prins, Maria; de Vries, Henry J.

Break-down of this delicate balance under sustained exposure to stressors (e.g. unhealthy diets) can, however, contribute to the onset of disease. Diet is a key modifiable environmental factor that modulates the gut microbiota and its metabolic capacities that, in turn, could impact human physiology. On this basis, the diet and the gut microbiota could act as synergistic forces that provide resilience against disease or that speed the progress from health to disease states. Associations between unhealthy dietary patterns, non communicable diseases and intestinal dysbiosis can be explained by this hypothesis. Translational studies showing that dietary-induced alterations in microbial communities recapitulate some of the pathological features of the original host further support this notion. In this introductory paper by the European project MyNewGut, we briefly summarize the investigations conducted to better understand the role of dietary patterns and food components in metabolic and mental health and the specificities of the microbiome-mediating mechanisms. We also discuss how advances in the understanding of the microbiome's role in dietary health effects can help to provide acceptable scientific grounds on which to base dietary advice for promoting healthy living.

Such communication is bi-directional and involves neuronal, endocrine, and immunological mechanisms. There is mounting data that gut microbiota is the source of a number of neuroactive and immunocompetent substances, which shape the structure and function of brain regions involved in the control of emotions, cognition, and physical activity. Most GI diseases are associated with altered transmission within the GBA that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Current treatment protocols for GI and non-GI disorders may positively or adversely affect the composition of intestinal microbiota with a diverse impact on therapeutic outcome(s). Alterations of gut microbiota have been associated with mood and depressive disorders. Moreover, mental health is frequently affected in GI and non-GI diseases. Deregulation of the GBA may constitute a grip point for the development of diagnostic tools and personalized microbiota-based therapy. For example, next generation sequencing (NGS) offers detailed analysis of microbiome footprints in patients with mental and GI disorders. Elucidating the role of stem cell-host microbiome cross talks in tissues in GBA disorders might lead to the development of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Psychobiotics are a new class of beneficial bacteria with documented efficacy for the treatment of GBA disorders.

The study objective was to evaluate the macronutrient, antimicrobial protein, and bacteria composition in expressed human milk acquired via commerce-free arrangements. Expressed human milk samples were collected from the following commerce-free scenarios: milk expressed for a mother's or parent's own infant (MOM; N = 30); unpasteurized milk donated to a non-profit milk bank (BANKED; N = 30); milk expressed for peer-to-peer milk sharing (SHARED; N = 31); and health professional-facilitated milk sharing where donors are serologically screened and milk is dispensed raw (SCREENED; N = 30). Analyses were conducted for total protein, lactose, percent fat and water, lysozyme activity, immunoglobulin A (IgA) activity, total aerobic bacteria, coliform, and Staphylococcus aureus. No bacterial growth was observed in 52/121 samples, and 15/121 had growth greater than 5.0 log colony-forming units/mL. There was no evidence of differences by groups (p > .05) in lactose, fat, water, lysozyme activity, sIgA activity, aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and S. aureus.

Morbidity has been linked to genetic processes, developmental history, and unique environmental exposures. Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, are also likely important factors in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). A community-based twin sample has many advantages for epigenetic studies, given the shared genetic and developmental histories of same-sex twin pairs. This article describes the rationale and study design for the Mood and Methylation Study in which 133 twin pairs (101 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic), both discordant and concordant for lifetime history of MDD, were evaluated on a large number of variables related to MDD. The twins also provided blood samples for an epigenome-wide association study of differentially methylated regions (DMR) relevant to MDD. Although MDD is typically considered a disorder of the central nervous system, it is unfeasible to obtain a large sample of brain tissues. However, epigenetic variation is not limited to the affected tissue but can also be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. Thus, this study focused on monocytes for the major analyses. Additional plans for the study include gene expression analysis from the same set of twins using RNA-seq and validation of significant DMRs in postmortem brain tissues from a separate sample. Moreover, sufficient samples have been collected to perform future multi-omic' analyses, including metabolome, microbiome, and transcriptome. Our long-term goal is to understand how epigenomic and other omic' factors can be manipulated for diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic purposes for MDD and its related conditions.","[Strachan, Eric; Roy-Byrne, Peter P.; Fowler, Emily] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zhao, Jinying] Univ Florida, Dept Epidemiol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Bacus, Tamara] Univ Washington, Dept Pediat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH097018],"This research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH097018: Zhao, Strachan).",1,DEC,2018,21,6,10.1017/thg.2018.64,Genetics & Heredity; Obstetrics & Gynecology

In animal models, MIA causes neurochemical and anatomic changes in the brain that correspond to those found in humans with the disorders.

There is scope to better understand how vitamin D deficiency interacted with other diseases to affect health in past groups. This study investigated paleopathological evidence and documentary records of individual cause of death to examine disease co-occurrence in a group of mid-19th century child burials from London, UK. Twenty-one percent of children had vitamin D deficiency rickets (138/642) and 36 children with rickets had an identified cause of death. Cyclical episodes of metabolic and nutritional deficiencies (rickets and scurvy) had occurred during childhood. Active rickets cooccurred with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in a small number of children, likely reflecting vitamin D's role in supporting immune function. Consideration of the stage of the vitamin D deficiency showed that the majority of children were affected by chronic disease loads indicative of multiple episodes of illness. Reconstructions of the wider health consequences of vitamin D deficiency in past groups are dependent on recognising whether the deficiency was active or healed.

It is becoming increasingly accepted that the flaws of the DSM relate to its struggles to pick out ""real"" entities as opposed to clusters of symptoms. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) was formulated in response to this failure, and attempts to address the concerns confronting the DSM by shifting to a causal and continuous model of psychopathology. Noting key criticisms of neurocentricism and problems with conceptual validity leveled at the RDoC, we argue that they stem from its grounding in the metaphysical position of eliminative materialism, or at least material-reductionism. We propose that 3e cognition (viewing the mind as embodied, embedded, and enactive) offers a superior alternative to eliminative materialism. A 3e-informed framework of mental disorder is sketched out and its advantages as a basis for classifying and conceptualizing mental disorders are considered.","[Nielsen, Kristopher] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Psychol, Wellington, New Zealand; [Ward, Tony] Victoria Univ Wellington, Clin Psychol, Wellington, New Zealand",,,1,DEC,2018,28,6,10.1177/0959354318808394,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary"

Continuously emerging epidemiological data and experimental models are showing additional protective effects of metformin against a number of age-related diseases (ARDs), e.g., cardiovascular diseases and cancer. This evidence has prompted the design of a specific trial, i.e., the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial, to test metformin as an anti ageing molecule. However, a unifying or prevailing mechanism of action of metformin is still debated. Here, we summarize the epidemiological data linking metformin to ARD prevention. Then, we dissect the deeply studied mechanisms of action explaining its antihyperglycemic effect and the putative mechanisms supporting its anti ageing properties, focusing on studies using clinically pertinent doses. We hypothesize that the molecular observations obtained in different models with metformin could be indirectly mediated by its effect on gut flora. Novel evidence suggests that metformin reshapes the human microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial bacterial species and counteracting the expansion of detrimental bacterial species. In turn, this action would influence the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory circulating factors, thereby promoting glycaemic control and healthy ageing. This framework may reconcile diverse observations, providing information for designing further studies to elucidate the complex interplay between metformin and the metabiome harboured in mammalian body compartments, thereby paving the way for innovative, bacterial-based therapeutics to manage type 2 diabetes and foster a longer healthspan.","[Prattichizzo, Francesco; La Sala, Lucia; Ceriello, Antonio] IRCCS MultiMed, Via Fantoli 16-15, Milan, Italy; [Giuliani, Angelica; Mensa, Emanuela; Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Rippo, Maria Rita; Procopio, Antonio Domenico; Olivieri, Fabiola] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Clin & Mol Sci, DISCLIMO, Ancona, Italy; [De Nigris, Valeria; Ceriello, Antonio] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; [Procopio, Antonio Domenico; Olivieri, Fabiola] IRCCS INRCA, Ctr Clin Pathol & Innovat Therapy, Italian Natl Res Ctr Aging, Ancona, Italy; [Ceriello, Antonio] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Diabet & Enfermedades Metab, Madrid, Spain",La Marato de TV3; IDIBAPS,This work was supported in part by grants from La Marato de TV3 and IDIBAPS to A.C.,4,DEC,2018,48,,10.1016/j.arr.2018.10.003,Cell Biology; Geriatrics & Gerontology

Depression provides a central pathway to immune dysregulation, inflammation, and poor health; gender-related differences in depression and inflammation can heighten risk for women compared to men. Sleep and obesity can simultaneously feed off depression as they promote it.

Both microbiota-mediated alterations in drug metabolism and drug-mediated alterations in the gut microbiome can have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. Greater insights into the mechanisms driving these reciprocal drug-gut microbiota interactions are needed to guide the development of microbiome-targeted dietary or pharmacological interventions, which may have the potential to enhance drug efficacy or reduce drug side effects.

Obesity is a risk factor for MDD, and there is evidence MDD increases risk of obesity. However, description of a bidirectional relationship between obesity and MDD is misleading, as closer examination reveals distinct unidirectional relationships in MDD subtypes. MDD is frequently associated with weight loss, although obesity promotes MDD. In contrast, MDD with atypical features (MDD-AF) is characterised by subsequent weight gain and obesity. The bases of these distinct associations remain to be detailed, with conflicting findings clouding interpretation. These associations can be viewed within a systems biology frameworkthe psycho-immune neuroendocrine (PINE) network shared between MDD and metabolic disorders. Shared PINE subsystem perturbations may underlie increased MDD in overweight and obese people (obesity-associated depression), while obesity in MDD-AF (depression-associated obesity) involves more complex interactions between behavioural and biomolecular changes. In the former, the chronic PINE dysfunction triggering MDD is augmented by obesity-dependent dysregulation in shared networks, including inflammatory, leptin-ghrelin, neuroendocrine, and gut microbiome systems, influenced by chronic image-associated psychological stress (particularly in younger or female patients). In MDD-AF, behavioural dysregulation, including hypersensitivity to interpersonal rejection, fundamentally underpins energy imbalance (involving hyperphagia, lethargy, hypersomnia), with evolving obesity exaggerating these drivers via positive feedback (and potentially augmenting PINE disruption). In both settings, sex and age are important determinants of outcome, associated with differences in emotional versus cognitive dysregulation. A systems biology approach is recommended for further research into the pathophysiological networks underlying MDD and linking depression and obesity.","[Patist, Carla M.; Stapelberg, Nicolas J.

However, babies born particularly by pre-labour caesarean section appear to have a subtly different physiology from those born by normal vaginal delivery, with both acute and chronic complications such as respiratory and cardio-metabolic morbidities being apparent. It has been hypothesized that inherent mechanisms within the process of labour and vaginal delivery, far from being a passive mechanical process by which the fetus and placenta are expelled from the birth canal, may trigger certain protective developmental processes permissive for normal immunological and physiological development of the fetus postnatally. Traditionally the primary candidate mechanism has been the hormonal surges or stress response associated with labour and vaginal delivery, but there is increasing awareness that transfer of the maternal microbiome to the infant during parturition. Transgenerational transmission of disease traits through epigenetics are also likely to be important. Interventions such as probiotics, neonatal gut seeding and different approaches to clinical care have potential to influence parturition physiology and improve outcomes for infants.","[Tribe, R.

Patents are thought to be critical in encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize new therapies, due to the high costs of researching diseases, developing treatments, and bringing drugs through the complex, expensive approval process. Scholars and policymakers often point to patent law's apparent success in the pharmaceutical industry to justify broader calls for more expansive patent rights. This Article challenges this conventional wisdom about the centrality of patents to drug development by presenting a case study of the role of patents in the emerging field of microbiome research. Scientists have recently begun to appreciate the important role played by the human microbiome, the community of microbes that lives within each of our bodies, in preventing and treating disease. The microbiome has been linked to autoimmune disorders, mental health conditions, and a range of conditions affecting our intestinal systems. Put simply, research involving the microbiome has the potential to change the future of medicine. There's just one problem: the microbiome can't meaningfully be patented. Several doctrines within patent law will make it extremely difficult for companies to obtain and enforce patents like the ones that are so readily available in most areas of medicine. Drawing on patent doctrine, patent searches, and interviews with scientists and lawyers, this Article demonstrates that companies are developing microbiome-based therapies largely in the absence of patent protection. Instead, the companies are relying on other innovation incentives to fill the gap. The microbiome's unpatentability presents an opportunity to evaluate whether patents are truly necessary for the development of new drugs. Congress, the NIH, and the FDA have implemented many innovation incentives throughout the development process, and we should not be astonished that removing a single such incentive, patent law, does not disrupt the entire system. Perhaps scholars should reconsider, if only selectively, our focus on patents as an irreplaceable driver of pharmaceutical innovation.","[Sachs, Rachel E.] Washington Univ, Sch Law, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",,,0,DEC,2018,117,3,,Law

Translocation of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) from the gut microbiota to blood circulation stimulates systemic inflammatory responses. Methods: To investigate increased gut permeability (a ""leaky gut"") as one potential mechanistic pathway from marital distress and depression to heightened inflammation, this secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized crossover study examined serial assessments of two endotoxin biomarkers, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) during two separate 9.5 h visits. The 43 (N = 86) healthy married couples, ages 24-61 (mean = 38.22), discussed a marital disagreement during both visits; behavioral coding of these interactions provided data on hostile marital behaviors, a hallmark of marital distress. The Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV assessed participants' mood disorder history. Results: Participants with more hostile marital interactions had higher LBP than those who were less hostile. Additionally, the combination of more hostile marital interactions with a mood disorder history was associated with higher LBP/sCD14 ratios. Higher LBP and LBP/sCD14 were associated with greater CRP production; for example, only 21% of low LBP participants (lowest quartile) had average CRP across the day > 3, compared to 79% of those in the highest quartile. Higher sCD14 was associated with higher IL-6. Conclusions: These bacterial LPS translocation data illustrate how a distressed marriage and a mood disorder history can promote a proinflammatory milieu through increased gut permeability, thus fueling inflammation-related disorders.","[Kiecolt-Glaser, Janice K.; Wilson, Stephanie J.; Bailey, Michael L.; Malarkey, William B.; Laskowski, Bryon; Belury, Martha A.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Inst Behav Med Res, 460 Med Ctr Dr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kiecolt-Glaser, Janice K.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bailey, Michael L.] Ohio State Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Columbus, OH USA; [Bailey, Michael L.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Microbial Pathogenesis, Columbus, OH USA; [Andridge, Rebecca] Ohio State Univ, Div Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Peng, Juan] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jaremka, Lisa M.] Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Newark, DE USA; [Fagundes, Christopher P.] Rice Univ, Dept Psychol, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Fagundes, Christopher P.] MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Behav Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Malarkey, William B.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Belury, Martha A.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Educ & Human Ecol, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R21 CA154054, K05 CA172296, R01 AG057032, T32 DE014320, K99 AG056667, UL1TR001070]","The study was supported in part by NIH grants R21 CA154054, K05 CA172296, R01 AG057032, T32 DE014320, K99 AG056667, and UL1TR001070.

Financial incentive strategies represent an innovative approach for increasing the use of counseling and pharmacotherapy. If effective, they could supplement or supplant resource-intensive policy options, particularly in populations for whom smoking has substantial societal costs. FIESTA (Financial IncEntives for Smoking TreAtment) will randomize hospitalized smokers to receive usual smoking cessation care alone or usual smoking care augmented with financial incentives. We aim to compare the impact of these two strategies on 1) smoking abstinence, 2) use of counseling and nicotine replacement therapy, and 3) quality of life of participants. We also will evaluate the short-term and long-term return on the investment of incentives. The FIESTA Oral Microbiome Substudy will compare the oral microbiome of smokers and nonsmokers to longitudinally assess whether smoking cessation changes oral microbiome composition.MethodsWe will enroll 182 inpatient participants from the Manhattan campus of the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System. All participants receive enhanced usual care, including screening for tobacco use, counseling while hospitalized, access to nicotine replacement therapy, and referral to a state Quitline. Patients in the financial incentive arm receive enhanced usual care and up to $550 for participating in the New York Smoker's Quitline, using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and achieving biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 2months and 6months. In the microbiome substudy, we enroll nonsmoking control participants matched to each recruited smoker's hospital ward, sex, age, diabetes status, and antibiotic use. After discharge, participants are asked to complete periodic phone interviews at 2weeks, 2months, 6months, and 12months and provide expired carbon monoxide and saliva samples at 2months, 6months, and 12months for cotinine testing and oral microbiome analysis.DiscussionThe incentive interventions of FIESTA may benefit hospitalized smokers, an objective made all the more critical because smoking rates among hospitalized patients are higher than those in the general population. Moreover, the focus of FIESTA on evidence-based therapy and bioconfirmed smoking cessation can help guide policy efforts to reduce smoking-related healthcare costs in populations with high rates of tobacco use and costly illnesses.","[French, Katherine M.; Gonzalez, Sasha Z.; Sherman, Scott E.; Link, Alissa R.; Malik, Sadozai Zoe] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth, 227 East 30th St, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Sherman, Scott E.] VA New York Harbor Healthcare Syst, Dept Med, 423 East 23rd St, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Sherman, Scott E.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, 560 First Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Tseng, Chi-Hong; Ladapo, Joseph A.] UCLA, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jumkhawala, Saahil A.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, 145 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Tejada, Briesny] New York Med Coll, 40 Sunshine Cottage Rd, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA; [White, Andrew] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Coll Med, 450 Clarkson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Ladapo, Joseph A.] UCLA, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res, 911 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",Robert Wood Johnson FoundationRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) [74140]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [K24 DA038345],"This study is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (grant 74140 to JAL and SES) and NIH K24 DA038345 (to SES).

Notably, the groupings identified by metaproteomics are not apparent from the bioarchaeological analysis, illustrating that quantitative metaproteomics has the potential to provide additional levels of molecular information about the oral health status of individuals from archeological contexts.","[Jersie-Christensen, Rosa R.; Mackie, Meaghan; Kelstrup, Christian D.; Olsen, Jesper V.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn, Prote Program,Ctr Prot Res, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Lanigan, Liam T.; Mackie, Meaghan; Fotakis, Anna K.; Cappellini, Enrico] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Lyon, David; Jensen, Lars J.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn, Dis Syst Biol Program,Ctr Prot Res, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Belstrom, Daniel] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Odontol, Periodontol & Microbiol, Norre Alle 20, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Willerslev, Eske] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Lynnerup, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Inst Forens Med, Lab Biol Anthropol, Frederik Vs Vej 11, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Danmarks Grundforskningsfond (Danish National Research Foundation)Danmarks Grundforskningsfond [DNRF128]; Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk [NNF14CC0001]; VILLUM Fonden [17649],"This work was in part funded by the University of Copenhagen (KU2016 programme), as well as Danmarks Grundforskningsfond (Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF128)).

In turn, the United States (US) Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) was conceptualized as a means by which to serially collect microbiome and health- related data from those seeking care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In this manuscript, exposures related to military experiences, as well as conditions and health- related factors among patients seen in VHA clinical settings are discussed in relation to common psychological and physical outcomes. Upon enrollment in the study, Veterans complete psychometrically sound (i.e., reliable and valid) measures regarding their past and current medical history. Participants also provide skin, oral, and gut microbiome samples, and permission to track their health status via the VHA electronic medical record. To date, data collection efforts have been cross-diagnostic. Within this manuscript, we describe current data collection practices and procedures, aswell as highlight demographic, military, and psychiatric characteristics of the first 188 Veterans enrolled in the study. Based on these findings, we assert that this cohort is unique as compared to those enrolled in recent large-scale studies of the microbiome. To increase understanding regarding disease and health among diverse cohorts, efforts such as the US-VMP are vital. Ongoing barriers and facilitators to data collection are discussed, as well as future research directions, with an emphasis on the importance of shifting current thinking regarding the microbiome from a focus on normalcy and dysbiosis to health promotion and disease prevention.","[Brenner, Lisa A.; Stearns-Yoder, Kelly A.; Heinze, Jared D.; Postolache, Teodor T.; Hadidi, Daniel A.; Hoffmire, Claire A.; Stanislawski, Maggie A.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Rocky Mt Reg VA Med Ctr MIRECC, Rocky Mt Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.; Stearns-Yoder, Kelly A.; Hadidi, Daniel A.; Hoffmire, Claire A.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Dept Psychiat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Dept Neurol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.; Hoisington, Andrew J.; Stearns-Yoder, Kelly A.; Postolache, Teodor T.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Mil & Vet Microbiome Consortium Res & Educ, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Hoisington, Andrew J.] Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA; [Stamper, Christopher E.; Heinze, Jared D.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Postolache, Teodor T.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Mood & Anxiety Program, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Postolache, Teodor T.] VISN 5 MIRECC, Dept Vet Affairs, Baltimore, MD USA; [Stanislawski, Maggie A.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Dept Epidemiol, Aurora, CO USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Ctr Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Ctr Neurosci, Aurora, CO USA",Veterans Health Administration Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Center (MIRECC),"This project was in part supported by the Veterans Health Administration Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Center (MIRECC).

The conventional focus has been to rigidly limit all types of carbohydrate. While controlling glucose, this approach fosters maternal anxiety and is a primary barrier to adherence. Many mothers substitute fat for carbohydrate, which may unintentionally enhance lipolysis, promote elevated free fatty acids (FFA), and worsen maternal insulin resistance (IR). Nutrition that worsens IR may facilitate nutrient shunting across the placenta, promoting excess fetal fat accretion. Evidence suggests that liberalizing higher quality, nutrient-dense carbohydrates results in controlled fasting/postprandial glucose, lower FFA, improved insulin action, vascular benefits, and may reduce excess infant adiposity. Thus, a less carbohydrate-restricted approach may improve maternal adherence when combined with higher quality carbohydrates, lower fat, appropriate caloric intake, and ethnically acceptable foods. Such a diet can be culturally sensitive, socioeconomically attentive, minimize further weight gain in GDM, with potential relevance for pregnancies complicated by overweight/obesity. Future research is needed to better understand the effect of macronutrient composition on the placenta and gut microbiome, the benefits/risks of nonnutritive sweeteners, and whether precision-nutrition is beneficial in pregnancy.

Interpreting these networks is not straightforward, and the biological implications of network properties are unclear. Analysis of microbial networks allows researchers to predict hub species and species interactions. Additionally, such analyses can help identify alternative community states and niches. Here, we review factors that can result in spurious predictions and address emergent properties that may be meaningful in the context of the microbiome. We also give an overview of studies that analyse microbial networks to identify new hypotheses. Moreover, we show in a simulation how network properties are affected by tool choice and environmental factors. For example, hub species are not consistent across tools, and environmental heterogeneity induces modularity. We highlight the need for robust microbial network inference and suggest strategies to infer networks more reliably.","[Rottjers, Lisa; Faust, Karoline] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Rega Inst, Lab Mol Bacteriol, Leuven, Belgium",KU LeuvenKU Leuven,This work was supported by KU Leuven.,26,NOV,2018,42,6,10.1093/femsre/fuy030,Microbiology

This study used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 1996 to 2013. A total of 27,041 patients with PD were enrolled as a study group, and 108,149 patients without PD were selected as the control group after matching by gender, age, insured region, urbanization, and income with a 1:4 ratio. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the risk of IBD. Of the 135,190 participants enrolled in this study, 5392 (4%) with newly diagnosed IBD were identified. The overall incidence of subsequent IBD was similar in both groups (3.8% vs. 4%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.08). However, an increased risk of UC in the PD group was found after adjusting confounding factors (aHR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.13-2.15; p < 0.05). This study demonstrated that patients with PD had approximately one-half higher risk of subsequent UC.

Gut-directed hypnotherapy (GHT) has been shown to improve quality of life and symptoms in IBS. This therapy targets psychological coping, central nervous processing and brain-gut interaction. Studies have also demonstrated effects of hypnosis on intestinal transit and the mucosal immune system. So far, no study has examined the effect of GHT on the intestinal microbiome. This study aimed at examining microbial composition, IBS symptoms, and psychological distress before and after GHT. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 38 IBS patients (Rome-III criteria, mean age 44 years, 27 female, 11 male, 22 diarrhea-dominant, 12 alternating-type and 4 constipation-dominant IBS) before and after 10 weekly group sessions of GHT. Assessments in psychological (perceived stress, PSQ; psychological distress, HADS-D; quality of life, visual analogue scales) and IBS symptom-related variables (IBS severity, IBS-SSS; single symptoms, visual analogue scales) were performed with validated questionnaires. Fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1-2). Results: Microbial alpha diversity was stable before and after GHT (chao1 2591 +/- 548 vs. 2581 +/- 539, p = 0.92). No significant differences were found in relative bacterial abundances but trends of reduced abundance of Lachnospiraceae 32.18 (4.14-39.89) Median (Q1-Q3) vs. 28.11 (22.85; 35.55) and Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio after GHT were observable. Significant reductions in symptom severity (323 (266-371) vs. 264 (191-331), p = 0.001) and psychological distress 17.0 (12.6-21.8) vs. 12.0 (8.3-18.0), p = 0.001, and increased well-being were found after GHT. Adequate relief after therapy was reported by 32 (84%) patients. Conclusion: Reductions in IBS symptoms and psychological burden were observed after gut-directed hypnotherapy, but only small changes were found in intestinal microbiota composition. The findings suggest that hypnosis may act by central nervous impact and other factors largely independent from microbiota composition modulating the brain-gut axis, possibly alterations in vagus nerve functioning and microbiota metabolism.","[Peter, Johannes; Fournier, Camille; Keip, Bettina; Rittershaus, Nina; Stephanou-Rieser, Nicola; Dejaco, Clemens; Michalski, Maria; Moser, Gabriele] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Internal Med 3, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Durdevic, Marija] Med Univ Graz, Med Res Ctr, A-8036 Graz, Austria","Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Anniversary fund [16506]; Oesterreichische Gesellschaft fuer Gastroenterologie und Hepatologie (OEGGH)","This research was funded by Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Anniversary fund, grant number 16506 and the Oesterreichische Gesellschaft fuer Gastroenterologie und Hepatologie (OEGGH).",0,NOV,2018,19,11,10.3390/ijms19113619,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary"

Potential applications are wide-ranging from elementary schools to airports to hospitals. Here we present an overview of the present knowledge and provide recommendations for future research aimed at exploring the impact of therapy dogs on the rehabilitation of Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a focus on the microbiome. Research Method/Design: In this review we searched the literature for studies that were conducted involving Veterans and service dogs. Because of the limited number of studies, we conducted a nonsystematic review to include the topics of the microbiome and psychological mechanisms that may play a role in rehabilitation of Veterans with dogs. Results: Whether dogs can be used as an intervention to increase function among those with PTSD remains a question. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that dog ownership may improve mental health outcomes via multiple mechanisms, such as decreasing social isolation and increasing physical activity and exposure to green spaces. The presence of a dog in the home may alter the human inhabitants' microbiomes, thereby, potentially providing an additional mechanism through which service dogs may influence human health and well-being. Conclusions/Implications: Theoretically, the use of service dogs for rehabilitation of Veterans with PTSD could improve mental health outcomes.

However, alleviating gastrointestinal (GI) problems, which are prevalent in ASD patients, can significantly improve the core symptoms of autism. Previous studies have associated GI disorders in ASD patients with abnormal gut microbiota, although few disease-related microorganisms have been identified. Considering that the gut microbiome affects the intestinal immune system and the patient's behavior, and that immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the main antibody secreted by intestinal immune cells, we investigated stool IgA content as a means of understanding the gut immune status of ASD patients. The IgA level in gut can be used as factor to know the Gene x Environment interactions and diagnose of ASDs. Methods: We enrolled 43 ASD patients and 31 gender- and age-matched healthy children. Stool IgA content was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We found that IgA levels were significantly higher in stool samples from ASD patients than from healthy children (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Conclusions: This finding may suggest the presence of gut immune abnormalities in ASD patients. Further studies with larger patient and control cohorts will be necessary to determine whether stool IgA levels can be used as a biomarker for ASDs.","[Zhou, Jiaxiu] Shenzhen Childrens Hosp, Div Psychol, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Fusheng; Guo, Hailiang; Zhou, Wenhao] Shenzhen Following Precis Med Res Inst, Autism Res Ctr, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Feng] Shenzhen Childrens Hosp, Div Speech Therapy, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zheng] Shenzhen Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Treatment, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yingjun] Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Key Lab Major Obstet Dis Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shaoming] Shenzhen Childrens Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jingwen; Xu, Ruihuan] Longgang Cent Hosp Shenzhen, Clin Lab, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan] Shenzhen Imuno Biotech Co Ltd, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Guo, Hailiang; Zhou, Wenhao] Fudan Univ, Childrens Hosp, Key Lab Birth Defects, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wenhao; Wang, Mingbang] Fudan Univ, Childrens Hosp, Div Neonatol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wenhao] Fudan Univ, Childrens Hosp, Key Lab Neonatal Dis, Natl Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mingbang] Fudan Univ, Childrens Hosp, Xiamen Branch, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81701351, 81500974]; Shenzhen Science Technology Research & Development Fund [JCYJ20160429174706491, JCYJ20160427101538845]; Shenzhen Science Technology and Innovation Commission [JCYJ20170413093358429]; National High Technology Research and Development Programs (""863 Program"") [2015AA020405]; Shenzhen Imuno Biotech Co., Ltd [2015A008]","This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program Nos. 81701351 and 81500974), the Shenzhen Science Technology Research & Development Fund (Program Nos.

This study confronts this question here by developing an inductive analysis based on emerging research fields of human microbiome, evolutionary robotics and astrobiology (also called exobiology). Data analysis considers papers associated with subject areas of authors from starting years to 2017 per each research field under study. Findings suggest some empirical properties of the evolution of research fields: the first property states that the evolution of a research field is driven by few disciplines (3-5) that generate more than 80% of documents (concentration of scientific production); the second property states that the evolution of research fields is path-dependent of critical disciplines: they can be parent disciplines that have originated the research field or new disciplines emerged during the evolution of science; the third property states that the evolution of research fields can be also due to a new discipline originated from a process of specialization within applied or basic sciences and/or convergence between disciplines. Finally, the fourth property states that the evolution of specific research fields can be due to both applied and basic sciences. These results here can explain and generalize some characteristics of the evolution ofscientific fields in the dynamics of science. Overall, then, this study begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, the generalproperties of the evolution of research fields to lay a foundation for the development of sophisticated theories of the evolution of science.","[Coccia, Mario] CNR Natl Res Council Italy, Rome, Italy; [Coccia, Mario] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Coccia, Mario] IRCRES CNR, Coll Carlo Alberto, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Turin, Italy",CNR - National Research Council of ItalyItalian National Research Council; National Endowment for the Humanities [0003005-2016],"The research in this paper was conducted while the author was a visiting scholar of the Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity at the Arizona State University funded by CNR - National Research Council of Italy and The National Endowment for the Humanities (Research Grant No. 0003005-2016).

RD can break down the rectal mucosal barrier and potentially affect the rectal microbiome. The objective of this study was to understand if RD is associated with acquiring rectal infections (RI) with rectal gonorrhoea (NG) and/or chlamydia (CT). Methods From 2013 to 2015, 395 adult HIV-uninfected MSM were enrolled in a randomised controlled study for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence with routine sexual risk survey and testing. Using data from this cohort, baseline differences by RI were assessed using Pearson's chi(2) and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Association between RD and RI was modelled using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders (sexual behaviour, substance use and age) selected a priori. Effect modification by number of male partners and sensitivity analysis to rule out reverse causality were also conducted. Results Of 395 participants, 261 (66%) performed RD and 133 (33%) had at least one NG/CT RI over 48 weeks. Number of condomless anal receptive sex (med: 4, p<0.001), male partners (med: 6, p<0.001) and substance use (any of methamphetamine/hallucinogens/dissociative/poppers) (p<0.001) were associated with increased odds of RI. Controlling for potential confounders, odds of prevalent RI were 3.59 (p<0.001, 95% CI 1.90 to 6.78) and incident RI 3.87 (p=0.001, 95% CI 1.78 to 8.39) when douching weekly or more compared with not douching. MSM with more than six male partners had 5.34 (p=0.002, 95% CI 1.87 to 15.31) increased odds of RI when douching weekly or more compared with not douching. Conclusion Rectal hygiene with RD is a common practice (66%) among HIV-uninfected MSM on PrEP in this study, which increases the odds of acquiring rectal NG and/or CT independent of sexual risk behaviour, substance use and other factors. This suggests interventional approaches targeting rectal hygiene products and practices could reduce sexually transmitted infections.","[Hassan, Adiba; Blumenthal, Jill S.; Ellorin, Eric; Morris, Sheldon R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Antiviral Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Dube, Michael P.] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Corado, Katya] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Los Angeles Biomed Res Inst, Div HIV Med, Torrance, CA 90509 USA; [Moore, David J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","California HIV Research Program [CHRP-MC08-SD-700, EI-11-SD-005]",Data for this study were collected as part of the main CCTG 595 study supported by the California HIV Research Program (CHRP-MC08-SD-700 and EI-11-SD-005).,1,NOV,2018,94,7,10.1136/sextrans-2017-053484,Infectious Diseases

There is, however, a relatively limited understanding of the broader environmental factors, particularly social conditions, that shape variation in human microbial communities. Fulfilling the promise of microbiome research - particularly the microbiome's potential for modification - will require collaboration between biologists and social and population scientists. For life scientists, the plasticity and adaptiveness of the microbiome calls for an agenda to understand the sensitivity of the microbiome to broader social environments already known to be powerful predictors of morbidity and mortality. For social and population scientists, attention to the microbiome may help answer nagging questions about the underlying biological mechanisms that link social conditions to health.

Probiotic organisms such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria modulate inflammation in humans and animal models. The trial examined whether the administration of probiotic organisms prevents psychiatric rehospitalizations in patients recently discharged following hospitalization for mania. Patients hospitalized for mania (N=66) were randomized after discharge to receive 24weeks of adjunctive probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain Bb12) or adjunctive placebo in a parallel two-group design format. The effect of treatment group on the risk of rehospitalization was calculated using Cox regression models. The modulating effect of systemic inflammation was measured employing an inflammation score based on immunoglobulin levels directed at previously defined antigens. ResultsConclusionDuring the 24-week observation period there were a total of 24 rehospitalizations in the 33 individuals who received placebo and eight rehospitalizations in the 33 individuals who received the probiotics (z=2.63, P=.009). Hazard functions indicated that the administration of the probiotics was associated with a significant advantage in time to all psychiatric rehospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] =0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10, .69; P=.007). Probiotic treatment also resulted in fewer days rehospitalized (mean 8.3 vs 2.8days for placebo and probiotic treatment, respectively; (2)=5.17, P=.017). The effect of the probiotic treatment on the prevention of rehospitalization was increased in individuals with elevated levels of systemic inflammation at baseline. Probiotic supplementation is associated with a lower rate of rehospitalization in patients who have been recently discharged following hospitalization for mania.","[Dickerson, Faith; Adamos, Maria; Katsafanas, Emily; Khushalani, Sunil; Origoni, Andrea; Savage, Christina; Schweinfurth, Lucy; Stallings, Cassie; Sweeney, Kevin; Goga, Joshana] Sheppard Pratt Hlth Syst, Stanley Res Program Sheppard Pratt, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA; [Yolken, Robert H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanley Div Dev Neurovirol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Stanley Medical Research Institute [11T-003],"Stanley Medical Research Institute, Grant/Award Number: #11T-003",15,NOV,2018,20,7,10.1111/bdi.12652,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Psychiatry

The etiology of ASD is not yet completely understood; however, a disorder in the gut-brain axis is emerging as a prominent factor leading to autism. To identify the taxonomic composition and markers associated with ASD, we compared the fecal microbiota of 30 ASD children diagnosed using Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, DSM-5 approved AIIMS-modified INCLEN Diagnostic Tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (INDT-ASD), and Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA) tool, with family-matched 24 healthy children from Indian population using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicon. Our study showed prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of ASD children, with higher relative abundances of families Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteraceae, and Veillonellaceae, whereas the gut microbiome of healthy children was dominated by the family Prevotellaceae. Comparative meta-analysis with a publicly available dataset from the US population consisting of 20 ASD and 20 healthy control samples from children of similar age, revealed a significantly high abundance of genus Lactobacillus in ASD children from both the populations. The results reveal the microbial dysbiosis and an association of selected Lactobacillus species with the gut microbiome of ASD children.","[Pulikkan, Joby; Mohan, Binoop; Grace, Tony] Cent Univ Kerala, Dept Genom Sci, Kasaragod, India; [Maji, Abhijit; Dhakan, Darshan Bharat; Saxena, Rituja; Sharma, Vineet K.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Dept Biol Sci, Metagen & Syst Biol Grp, Bhopal, India; [Anto, Milu Maria] Prajyoti Niketan Coll, Dept Psychol, Pudukad, Kerala, India; [Agarwal, Neeti] Mahaveer Inst Med Sci, Dept Paediat & Neurol, Bhopal, India; [Grace, Tony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","IISER Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India; Central University of Kerala, Kerala, India","This work was supported by the intramural funding received from IISER Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, and Central University of Kerala, Kerala, India.",19,NOV,2018,76,4,10.1007/s00248-018-1176-2,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Microbiology

The setting for this descriptive cohort design study was a 32-bed inpatient unit in a tertiary pediatric hospital serving children with immune compromised conditions, including cancer and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplants. Between January 2006 and December 2016, 265 CLABSIs involving 189 patients were reported. Data were organized into three time periods: 5-year preintervention baseline (2006-2010), implementation of maintenance care bundles (2011-2012), and addition of formalized supportive care practices to the maintenance care bundles (2013-2016). Organisms were categorized into four groups based on the National Health Safety Network organism list. Time-by-class Poisson regression models evaluated changes in CLABSI rates. Characteristics of patients who developed CLABSIs were unchanged. Infections occurred most frequently among patients with hematologic malignancies and neutropenia. Significant log rate decreases in CLABSI rates were observed with the implementation of maintenance care bundles plus enhanced supportive cares compared to preintervention baseline for the following organisms: (1) common commensal organisms (-1.05, p = .005), (2) mucosal barrier injury (MBI) organisms common to the mouth (-.708, p = .007), and (3) other noncommensal/non-MBI pathogens (-.77, p = .005). Rates were unchanged for MBI organisms common to the lower gastrointestinal tract. Central line maintenance care bundles and formalized supportive care practices resulted in sustained decreased CLABSI rates.

In the past 7 years, we have studied the role of microbiota-brain communication on behavior in mouse models using germ-free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics, and healthy specific pathogen free mice. Through our work and that of others, we have seen an amazing increase in our knowledge of how bacteria signal to the brain and the implications this has for psychiatry. Gut microbiota composition and function are influenced both by genetics, age, sex, diet, life experiences, and many other factors of psychiatric and bodily disorders and thus may act as potential biomarkers of the gut-brain axis that could be used in psychiatry and co-morbid conditions. There is a particular need in major depressive disorder and other mental illness to identify biomarkers that can stratify patients into more homogeneous groups to provide better treatment and for development of new therapeutic approaches. Peripheral outcome measures of host-microbe bidirectional communication have significant translational value as biomarkers. Enabling stratification of clinical populations, based on individual biological differences, to predict treatment response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

For instance, microbiota can also influence the immune response through the activation of the immune system or through the release of mediators that are able to cross the brain blood barrier or that can interact with other substances that have free access to the brain, such as tryptophan and kynurenic acid, which is a metabolite of tryptophan and which has been involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Objectives: This paper reviews the possible relationships between microbiome, schizophrenia and treatment resistance. Given the possibility of a role of immune activation and alterations, we also describe the relationship between schizophrenia and immune inflammatory response. Finally, we report on the studies about the use of probiotic and prebiotics in schizophrenia. Methods: Cochrane library and PubMed were searched from the year 2000 to 2018 for publications about microbiome, immune-mediated pathology, schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. The following search string was used: (microbiome or immune mediated) AND (schizophrenia OR neurodevelopmental disorder). Associated publications were hand-searched from the list of references of the identified papers. A narrative review was also conducted about the use of probiotics and prebiotics in schizophrenia. Results: There exists a close relationship between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it likely that there is a relationship between schizophrenia, including its resistant forms, and microbiota. This paper provides a summary of the most important studies that we identified on the topic. Conclusions: Schizophrenia in particular, remain a challenge for researchers and practitioners and the possibility of a role of the microbiome and of immune-mediated pathology should be better explored, not only in animal models but also in clinical trials of agents that are able to alter gut microbiota and possibly influence the mechanisms of gastrointestinal inflammation. Microbiome targeted treatments have not been well-studied yet in patients with mental illness in general, and with schizophrenia in particular. Nonetheless, the field is well worth of being appropriately investigated.","[Cuomo, Alessandro; Crescenzi, Bruno Beccarini; Bolognesi, Simone; Di Muro, Angela; Goracci, Arianna; Nitti, Maria; Pieraccini, Fulvio; Fagiolini, Andrea] Univ Siena, Dept Mol & Dev Med, Siena, Italy; [Maina, Giuseppe] Univ Torino, Dept Neurosci, Turin, Italy; [Rosso, Gianluca] Univ Torino, San Luigi Gonzaga Hosp Orbassano, Psychiat Unit, Turin, Italy; [Giordano, Nicola] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurol Sci, Siena, Italy; [Neal, Stephen M.] West Virginia Sch Osteopath Med, Dept Psychiat, Lewisburg, WV USA","General Psychiatry Residency Program of the University of Siena School of Medicine, Siena, Italy","This paper was funded via the General Psychiatry Residency Program of the University of Siena School of Medicine, Siena, Italy.",3,Oct-15,2018,9,,10.3389/fphar.2018.01040,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

In this article, we propose that modern-day Indigenous population health may suffer from disrupted microbial ecosystems as a consequence of historical colonialism. Colonialism may have interrupted the established relationships between the environment, traditional lifeways, and microbiomes, altering the Indigenous microbiome with detrimental health consequences.","[Skelly, Emily; Cooper, Alan; Weyrich, Laura S.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Kapellas, Kostas] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Dent Sch, Australian Res Ctr Populat Oral Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE150101574],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE150101574",0,OCT,2018,167,2,10.1002/ajpa.23637,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

Considering that neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, have a strong genetic etiology, it is necessary to understand if genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Shank3, can influence the gut microbiome, and if probiotics can be a therapeutic tool. In this study, we have identified dysregulation of several genera and species of bacteria in the gut and colon of both male and female Shank3 KO mice. L. reuteri, a species with decreased relative abundance in the Shank3 KO mice, positively correlated with the expression of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits in the brain. Treatment of Shank3 KO mice with L. reuteri induced an attenuation of unsocial behavior specifically in male Shank3 mice, and a decrease in repetitive behaviors in both male and female Shank3 KO mice. In addition, L. reuteri treatment affected GABA receptor gene expression and protein levels in multiple brain regions. This study identifies bacterial species that are sensitive to an autism-related mutation, and further suggests a therapeutic potential for probiotic treatment.","[Tabouy, Laure; Getselter, Dimitry; Maayouf, Rasha; Werbner, Nir; Elliott, Evan] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Med Galilee, Mol & Behav Neurosci Lab, IL-1311502 Safed, Israel; [Ziv, Oren; Werbner, Nir; Ben-Amram, Hila; Nuriel-Ohayon, Meital; Koren, Omry] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Med Galilee, Microbiome Res Lab, IL-1311502 Safed, Israel; [Karpuj, Marcela] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Med Galilee, Genom Ctr, IL-1311502 Safed, Israel; [Karpuj, Marcela] Orte Braude, Biotechnol Engn Dept, IL-21616 Karmiel, Israel; [Tabouy, Timothee] Paris Saclay Univ, UMR Appl Math & Informat MIA Paris 518, French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France",Teva Pharmaceuticals,"We would like to thank the Genomic Center of the Bar Ilan University Faculty of Medicine and to Marina Kurtz, Yair Hershko, and Barak Hamami.

The etiology of ASD likely involves environmental factors triggering physiological abnormalities in genetically sensitive individuals. One of these major physiological abnormalities is mitochondrial dysfunction, which may affect a significant subset of children with ASD. Here we systematically review the literature on human studies of mitochondrial dysfunction related to ASD. Clinical aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD include unusual neurodevelopmental regression, especially if triggered by an inflammatory event, gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, motor delays, fatigue and lethargy. Traditional biomarkers of mitochondrial disease are widely reported to be abnormal in ASD, but appear non-specific. Newer biomarkers include buccal cell enzymology, biomarkers of fatty acid metabolism, non-mitochondrial enzyme function, apoptosis markers and mitochondrial antibodies. Many genetic abnormalities are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD, including chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial DNA mutations and large-scale deletions, and mutations in both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial nuclear genes. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in immune and buccal cells, fibroblasts, muscle and gastrointestinal tissue and thebrains of individuals with ASD. Several environmental factors, including toxicants, microbiome metabolites and an oxidized microenvironment are shown to modulate mitochondrial function in ASD tissues. Investigations of treatments for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD are promising but preliminary. The etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction and how to define it in ASD is currently unclear. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the mitochondria may be a fruitful target for treatment and prevention of ASD. Further research is needed to better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ASD.","[Rose, Shannon; Kahler, Stephen G.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Rose, Shannon; Kahler, Stephen G.] Arkansas Childrens Res Inst, Little Rock, AR USA; [Niyazov, Dmitriy M.] Ochsner Hlth Syst, Sect Med Genet, New Orleans, LA USA; [Rossignol, Daniel A.] Rossignol Med Ctr, Aliso Viejo, CA USA; [Goldenthal, Michael] Drexel Univ, St Christophers Hosp Children, Coll Med, Dept Pediat,Neurol Sect, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Frye, Richard E.] Phoenix Childrens Hosp, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurodev Disorders, Dept Neurol, 1919 E Thomas St, Phoenix, AZ 85016 USA; [Frye, Richard E.] Univ Arizona, Coll Med Phoenix, Dept Child Hlth, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA","Arkansas Biosciences Institute (Little Rock, AR, USA); Jonty Foundation (St. Paul, MN); Autism Research Institute (San Diego, CA); Gupta Family Foundation (Atherton, CA); Jane Bostford Johnson Foundation (New York, NY); Jager Family Foundation (Chicago, IL); Phoenix Children's Hospital Foundation (Phoenix, AZ)","We thank the families and individuals with ASD that participated in the Autism Genetic Research Exchange and the studies at the National Institutes of Mental Health for providing cell lines to us for research.

In animals, disruptions in social behavior can be modelled by administering bacterial mimetics such as liposaccharide (LPS). However, when evaluating social interactions in the laboratory, attention is rarely directed on the reciprocal relationship as a whole, which is important as peers may drive social withdrawal. Previously, we have shown that male adolescent rats treated neonatally (n) with LPS receive less contact from their con specifics in a social interaction test, and that this effect is mediated through olfactory communication. In the present study, we reconfirmed this effect using a more direct social test and evaluated the hypothesis that changes in the microbiome underlie the olfactory induced social aversion. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered nLPS (50 mu g/kg, i.p) or nSaline on postnatal days (P)3 and 5. On P40, adolescent nLPS treated males received less contact in a social preference test compared to nSaline treated controls, an effect not observed in females. To confirm that nLPS led male rats to elicit a scent cue, resulting in social aversion, a subset of neurotypical conspecifics underwent an anosmia procedure that disrupted their olfactory processing via olfactory neuroepithelium degeneration. This normalized the contact that they directed towards nLPS and nSaline male rats. Although 16 s rRNA sequencing failed to detect significant differences in bacterial phyla across either sex or neonatal treatment, treating male nLPS rats with an antibiotic cocktail, which induced clear changes in microbial communities, diminished the social rejection effect. Therefore, manipulation of the microbiome appears to affect social communication where there exists an underlying deficit. Moreover, our data reaffirm that social engagement is a reciprocal process and the behavior of all individuals within a dynamic interaction should be evaluated.","[Amanda, Kentner C.; Urma, Khan; MacRae, M.] Massachusetts Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Hlth Psychol Program, Sch Arts & Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Scot, Dowd E.] MR DNA Mol Res Lab, Shallowater, TX 79363 USA; [Yan Siyang] Massachusetts Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Sch Pharm, Boston, MA 02115 USA",MCPHS University Faculty Development Grant,We gratefully acknowledge the institutional support provided through a MCPHS University Faculty Development Grant awarded to A.C.K.

Invited speakers presented on innovations and advances in gut and nasal microbiota (normal microbial communities) in the first decade after the Human Microbiome Project began. The microbiota and their metabolites are now known to influence health and disease directly and indirectly, through modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems and barrier function. Disruption of healthy microbiota is often associated with changes in abundance and diversity of core microbial species (dysbiosis), caused by stressors including antibiotics, chemotherapy, and disease. Nucleic-acid-based metagenomic methods demonstrated that the dysbiotic host microbiota no longer provide normal colonization resistance to pathogens, a critical component of innate immunity of the superorganism. Diverse pathogens, probiotics, and prebiotics were considered in human and animal models (in vivo and in vitro). Discussion included approaches for design of future microbial dose-response studies to account for the presence of the indigenous microbiota that provide normal colonization resistance, and the absence of the protective microbiota in dysbiosis. As NextGen risk analysis methodology advances with the microbiome revolution, a proposed new framework, the Health Triangle, may replace the old paradigm based on the Disease Triangle (focused on host, pathogen, and environment) and germophobia. Collaborative experimental designs are needed for testing hypotheses about causality in dose-response relationships for pathogens present in our environments that clearly compete in complex ecosystems with thousands of bacterial species dominating the healthy superorganism.","[Coleman, Margaret] Coleman Sci Consulting, Groton, NY 13073 USA; [Elkins, Christopher] US FDA, US HHS, CFSAN, Riverdale, MD USA; [Gutting, Bradford] US Navy, Dahlgren, VA USA; [Mongodin, Emmanuel] UMD Med Sch, Baltimore, MD USA; [Solano-Aguilar, Gloria] USDA ARS, Beltsville, MD USA; [Walls, Isabel] USDA, NIFA, Washington, DC 20250 USA",SRASugar Research Australia,"The authors acknowledge support from the SRA dose response Specialty Group, especially to Drs.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics may alter the composition of the gut flora microbiota, which is hypothesized to be involved in the regulation of the immune system. This study examines the interplay among otitis media, antibiotics, and the subsequent risk of developing autism. Based on the entire Danish population, 780,547 children were followed from birth (January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2008) until December 31, 2012. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios and absolute risks of autism with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) related to previous otitis media diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions redeemed at Danish pharmacies. The absolute risk of autism before age 10 was increased among children with otitis media (1.2% for females and 3.3% for males) and in children who had redeemed an antibiotic prescription (0.6% and 2.7% for females and males) compared to children without a history of otitis media and antibiotics usage (0.4% for females and 1.9% for males). Similarly, we found an increased hazard ratio of autism associated with otitis media (1.83 95% CI 1.71-1.95) and antibiotics usage (1.29 95% CI 1.17-1.43). A history of both otitis media and antibiotic treatment did not further increase the risk of autism. Although the risk of autism was associated with otitis media and treatment with antibiotics, we found little evidence of a synergistic effect between otitis media infections and treatment with antibiotics.

These patterns are believed to be dysfunctional symptoms in executive processing, which impact other cognitive functions such as attention or cognitive flexibility. In recent years, several studies have shown that certain intestinal bacteria may play a role in shaping cognitive networks encompassing emotional and social domains. A microbiota-gut-brain axis is known to exist, establishing several mechanisms by which microbiota may modulate brain development, function and behaviour, including immune, endocrine and neural pathways. As the aetiology of ASD is largely unknown, some studies have shown that intestinal bacteria may be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this review was to focus on the role of the gut-brain axis in ASD and, specifically, on its role in executive functions. First, we summarize the relationship between the gastrointestinal and cognitive symptoms of ASD patients. In addition, we highlight the evidence that supports and emphasizes the involvement of gut microbiota, and the putative underlying mechanisms in this population. Finally, we present evidence from preclinical and clinical studies on the modulation of microbiota and their effects on cognitive symptoms, specifically in relation to executive function. In conclusion, manipulation of microbiota could be a positive intervention to improve ASD symptoms.

Previous studies have suggested a parallel segregation of microbial features and psychological burden in IBS. This study aimed at exploring the microbial correlates of psychological distress in patients with IBS. Methods Forty-eight patients with IBS (Rome III criteria, M (SD) age = 42 (15) years, 35 female, 25 diarrhea-dominant, 5 constipation-dominant, and 18 alternating-type IBS) were assessed for psychological and clinical variables with validated questionnaires, fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1-2). Microbial analyses comprised examination of alpha and beta diversity, correlational analyses of bacterial abundance and comparisons among subgroups defined by thresholds of psychological and IBS symptom variables, and machine learning to identify bacterial patterns corresponding with psychological distress. Results Thirty-one patients (65%) showed elevated psychological distress, 22 (31%) anxiety, and 10 depression (21%). Microbial beta diversity was significantly associated with distress and depression (q = .036 each, q values are p values false discovery rate-corrected for multiple testing). Depression was negatively associated with Lachnospiraceae abundance (Spearman's = -0.58, q = .018). Patients exceeding thresholds of distress, anxiety, depression, and stress perception showed significantly higher abundances of Proteobacteria (q = .020-.036). Patients with anxiety were characterized by elevated Bacteroidaceae (q = .036). A signature of 148 unclassified species accounting for 3.9% of total bacterial abundance co-varied systematically with the presence of psychological distress. Conclusions Psychological variables significantly segregated gut microbial features, underscoring the role of brain-gut-microbiota interaction in IBS.

Several metabolites generated by the gut microbiota have been reported to exert antidepressant-like effects, including the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate. However, recent work has suggested that the abundance of butyrate is not significantly changed in neither human nor experimental animals with depression, and butyrate has been reported to decrease upon the administration of prebiotics with antidepressant-like effects. Supplementation of endogenous metabolites that are unchanged in depression may induce additional metabolic disorders and may lead to poorer clinical outcomes. However, the endogenous metabolites that are imbalanced in depression may include several antidepressant candidates that could circumvent these problems. In this study, we used GC-MS spectrometry to study the fecal metabolome of rats under Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS). We carried out static and dynamic metabolomics analyses to identify the differential metabolites between the CUMS rats and control rats. We identified propionic acid, rather than butyric acid, as a differential metabolite of the CUMS rats. Consistent with this, a 1-week intrarectal administration of sodium propionate (NaP, the salt form of propionic acid) induced antidepressant-like effects and partially rebalanced the plasmametabolome. The antidepressant-like effects of NaP were correlated with differential rescue of neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex, which may be achieved through the reduction of catabolism of noradrenaline, tryptophan and dopamine, rather than serotonin. These findings support NaP as a potential candidate in fighting depression by administering an endogenous metabolite.","[Li, Jianguo; Wu, Changxin] Shanxi Univ, Lab Microbiome Sci, Inst Biomed Sci, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianguo; Qin, Xuemei] Shanxi Univ, Key Lab Chem Biol & Mol Engn, Minist Educ, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Hou, Luwen; Wang, Cui; Jia, Xueyang; Qin, Xuemei] Shanxi Univ, Modern Res Ctr Tradit Chinese Med, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570346],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31570346).,5,Sep-27,2018,9,,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00454,Psychiatry

Noise and infrastructure often change behavior and community composition, with potential physical costs such as decreased condition. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are virtually unknown. One potential driver of condition within a species is the diversity of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigate how the urban habitat affects the gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) males using spatial analyses of land cover (impervious, scrub, grass, and trees) at the regional level and territory level in urban San Francisco, CA and nearby rural Point Reyes, California. We hypothesized that urbanization of habitats affects gut microbial composition and diversity, potentially through direct effects on diet and/or indirect environmental effects. We measured gut microbial community diversity from 16s rRNA sequences amplified from cloacal swabs. We find that the urban and rural male gut microbiomes are significantly different, such that the urban gut microbiome is more diverse than the rural gut microbiome. This relationship may be due to more variable land cover types in urban habitats as compared to rural habitats, which are mainly composed of native scrub. We do not find support for regional impervious cover affecting the gut microbiome, but the more precise territory level analyses show that higher tree cover correlates with increased alpha diversity and impervious cover correlates with relative abundances of gut microbial taxa (Unifrac beta diversity). Although some studies show that gut diversity affects physiology, our measures of body condition do not indicate a strong relationship. Our results highlight how changes in the landscape may affect the gut microbiome of animals in an ever-urbanizing world, and provide a baseline for future studies of how anthropogenic change affects communities at multiple levels.","[Phillips, Jennifer N.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Berlow, Mae; Derryberry, Elizabeth P.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS- 1354763, 1354756, 1827290]; Tulane Gunning Award; Wilson Ornithological Society Grant; American Ornithologist's Union Van Tyne Award; Tulane EEB Graduate Student Award; Tulane One-Term Dissertation Award","This work was funded by NSF IOS- 1354763, 1354756, and 1827290; JP was supported by a Tulane Gunning Award, Tulane One-Term Dissertation Award, Wilson Ornithological Society Grant, and an American Ornithologist's Union Van Tyne Award.

The physiologic ""fight-or-flight"" response may be deleterious to the female lower genital tract microbiome if the stress stimuli persist for longer than necessary. Persistent exposure to psychosocial stress and stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes, and associated hormones are risk factors for several infections including genitourinary tract infections. Though this could be due to a dysregulated immune response, a cortisol-induced inhibition of vaginal glycogen deposition may be involved especially in the instance of vaginal infection. The estrogen-related increased vaginal glycogen and epithelial maturation are required for the maintenance of a healthy vaginal ecosystem (eubiosis). The ability of cortisol to disrupt this process as indicated in animal models is important in the pathogenesis of vaginal dysbiosis and the subsequent development of infection and inflammation. This phenomenon may be more crucial in pregnancy where a healthy Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota is sacrosanct, and there is local production of more corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the decidua, fetal membranes and placenta. To highlight the relationship between the stress hormone cortisol and the vaginal microbiomial architecture and function, the potential role of cortisol in the maintenance of vaginal health is examined.","[Amabebe, Emmanuel; Anumba, Dilly O.

Recent studies reported that children with ASD have altered gut microbiota profiles compared with typical development (TD) children. However, few studies on gut bacteria of children with ASD have been conducted in China. Here, in order to elucidate changes of fecal microbiota in children with ASD, 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted and the 16S rRNA (V3-V4) gene tags were amplified. We investigated differences in fecal microbiota between 35 children with ASD and 6 TD children. At the phylum level, the fecal microbiota of ASD group indicated a significant increase of the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio. At the genus level, we found that the relative abundance of Sutterella, Odoribacter and Butyricimonas was much more abundant in the ASD group whereas the abundance of Veillonella and Streptococcus was decreased significantly compared to the control group. Functional analysis demonstrated that butyrate and lactate producers were less abundant in the ASD group. In addition, we downloaded the association data set of microbe-disease from human microbe-disease association database and constructed a human disease network including ASD using our gut microbiome results. In this microbe-disease network based on microbe similarity of diseases, we found that ASD is positively correlated with periodontal, negatively related to type 1 diabetes. Therefore, these results suggest that microbe-based disease analysis is able to predict novel connection between ASD and other diseases and may play a role in revealing the pathogenesis of ASD.","[Zhang, Mengxiang; He, Yi; Wang, Juan] Peking Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Biomed Informat, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mengxiang; He, Yi; Wang, Juan] Peking Univ, Autism Res Ctr, Hlth Sci Ctr, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wei] PLA, Cent Lab, Navy Gen Hosp, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Juan] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Pediat, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",National Natural Science FundNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81473236],"We are very grateful to the children, families and school staff, who kindly took part in this research.

In turn, the gut microbiota influences the host stress response and associated sequelae, thereby implicating the gut microbiota as an important mediator of host health. This narrative review aims to summarize evidence concerning the impact of psychological, environmental, and physical stressors on gut microbiota composition and function. The stressors reviewed include psychological stress, circadian disruption, sleep deprivation, environmental extremes (high altitude, heat, and cold), environmental pathogens, toxicants, pollutants, and noise, physical activity, and diet (nutrient composition and food restriction). Stressors were selected for their direct relevance to military personnel, a population that is commonly exposed to these stressors, often at extremes, and in combination. However, the selected stressors are also common, alone or in combination, in some civilian populations. Evidence from preclinical studies collectively indicates that the reviewed stressors alter the composition, function and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, but that effects vary across stressors, and can include effects that may be beneficial or detrimental to host health. Translation of these findings to humans is largely lacking at present. This gap precludes concluding with certainty that transient or cumulative exposures to psychological, environmental, and physical stressors have any consistent, meaningful impact on the human gut microbiota. However, provocative preclinical evidence highlights a need for translational research aiming to elucidate the impact of stressors on the human gut microbiota, and how the gut microbiota can be manipulated, for example by using nutrition, to mitigate adverse stress responses.","[Karl, J.

Furthermore, the oropharynx represents the sole entry point to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI disturbances and alterations in the GI microbiome are established features of ASD, and may impact behavior through the ""microbial-gut-brain axis."" Most studies of the ASD microbiome have used fecal samples. Here, we identified changes in the salivary microbiome of children aged 2-6 years across three developmental profiles: ASD (n = 180), nonautistic developmental delay (DD; n = 60), and typically developing (TD; n = 106) children. After RNA extraction and shotgun sequencing, actively transcribing taxa were quantified and tested for differences between groups and within ASD endophenotypes. A total of 12 taxa were altered between the developmental groups and 28 taxa were identified that distinguished ASD patients with and without GI disturbance, providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in ASD. Group classification accuracy was visualized with receiver operating characteristic curves and validated using a 50/50 hold-out procedure. Five microbial ratios distinguished ASD from TD participants (79.5% accuracy), three distinguished ASD from DD (76.5%), and three distinguished ASD children with/without GI disturbance (85.7%). Taxonomic pathways were assessed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes microbial database and compared with one-way analysis of variance, revealing significant differences within energy metabolism and lysine degradation. Together, these results indicate that GI microbiome disruption in ASD extends to the oropharynx, and suggests oral microbiome profiling as a potential tool to evaluate ASD status.

However, the possible interactive role of gut microbiota and brain function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet. Methods: To explore this, we collected fecal samples and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC). Then we analyzed the differences in gut microbiota and choline concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results: Presences of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales were observed at increase levels in fecal samples of UHR subjects compared to the other two groups. The composition changes of gut microbiota indicate the i ncreased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of choline levels, a brain imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups. Conclusion: Both gut microbiome and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the brain and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Those microbes regulate soil fertility, plant health, and biogeochemical cycling. The existing studies have hardly focused on microbial diversity from urban parks, especially from China. As Shanghai, the largest city of China has experienced extensive urbanization, the present study focused on bacterial community compositions and their functional genes collected from 24 urban parks soils to ensure soil health and microbial sustainability of major parks of this city. To elucidate the bacterial communities from all 24 urban parks, soils were analyzed by sequencing V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq. At the taxonomic level, 12,67,055 16S rRNA gene sequences were secured from all the soil samples. Out of 43 classified phyla, all the urban park soils had higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria accounting for 33.01-45.49 and 18.7-30.12%, respectively. A total of 6909 bacterial functional genes showing high functional gene diversity for essential biogeochemical processes (including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycles) exist in Shanghai urban parks that could be helpful in maintaining fertility of park soils and thus greenery of city.

However, various dietary components or patterns may promote obesity and cardiometabolic disease by additional mechanisms that are not mediated solely by caloric content. Researchers explored this topic at the 2017 CrossFit Foundation Academic Conference 'Diet and Cardiometabolic Health - Beyond Calories', and this paper summarizes the presentations and follow-up discussions. Regarding the health effects of dietary fat, sugar and non-nutritive sweeteners, it is concluded that food-specific saturated fatty acids and sugar-sweetened beverages promote cardiometabolic diseases by mechanisms that are additional to their contribution of calories to positive energy balance and that aspartame does not promote weight gain. The challenges involved in conducting and interpreting clinical nutritional research, which preclude more extensive conclusions, are detailed. Emerging research is presented exploring the possibility that responses to certain dietary components/patterns are influenced by the metabolic status, developmental period or genotype of the individual; by the responsiveness of brain regions associated with reward to food cues; or by the microbiome. More research regarding these potential 'beyond calories' mechanisms may lead to new strategies for attenuating the obesity crisis.","[Stanhope, K. L.; Havel, P. J.; Allister-Price, C.; Sigala, D.

A healthy perinatal period requires significant adaptations; however, systems can become imbalanced resulting in depressive and anxiety symptoms. The interface between the microbiome, the immune system, and the stress system may be a model for understanding mechanisms underlying PMAD. Emerging literature from general populations regarding immune, hormone, and HPA axis changes in relation to the microbiome combined with literature on immune, gonadotropin, and stress systems in the perinatal period provides a background. We systematically investigated literature in the developing field of the microbiome in relation to PMAD. Our inclusion criteria were 1) reporting measure of maternal mood, stress, or anxious or depressed behavior; 2) in the perinatal period, defined as pregnancy through one year postpartum; and 3) reporting measure of maternal microbiome including manipulations of the microbiome through prebiotics, probiotics, or interventions with microbial byproducts. The review identified research studying associations between stress and maternal microbiome; dietary impacts on microbial composition, mood, and stress; and the relationship between the microbiome and the immune system through immunoregulatory mechanisms. Important themes identified include: the importance of studying the maternal microbiome and measures of stress, anxiety, and depression and that multi-hit models will be needed as research strives to determine the effects of multiple mechanisms working in concert.","[Rackers, Hannah S.; Kimmel, Mary C.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 304 MacNider Hall,CB 7160, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Thomas, Stephanie] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, 245 Rosenau Hall,CB 7461, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Williamson, Kelsey] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Posey, Rachael] Univ N Carolina, Hlth Sci Lib, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Posey, Rachael] North Carolina State Univ, William Rand Kenan Jr Lib Vet Med, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA",National Institutes of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1 K23 MH110660-01]; Brain and Behavior Foundation NARSAD Young Investigator Award; PS Fund; Foundation of Hope Seed Grant,"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Mental Health 1 K23 MH110660-01, the Brain and Behavior Foundation NARSAD Young Investigator Award, the P&S Fund, and The Foundation of Hope Seed Grant.",10,SEP,2018,95,,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.05.020,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences; Psychiatry

Ineffective pharmacotherapy in the management of cognitive deficits and weight gain are known to be significant contributors; therefore interventions that may mitigate one, or both, of these parameters would be highly beneficial. Manipulation of the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics may be one such intervention. Preclinical studies have shown that a 2-4 week dietary supplementation with a prebiotic has beneficial effects on learning and memory, and prevents pro-inflammatory signals that are detrimental to cognitive processes. Furthermore, prebiotics influence metabolism, and in obesity they increase the expression of anorexigenic gut hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine, glucagon-like peptide 1 and leptin, as well as decrease levels of orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin. Despite compelling evidence for the pro-cognitive and neuroprotective effects of prebiotics in rodents, their ability to alleviate cognitive deficits or enhance cognition needs to be evaluated in humans. Here we suggest that important symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as cognitive impairment and weight gain, may benefit from concurrent prebiotic therapy.","[Kao, Amy Chia-Ching; Burnet, Philip W.

Materials and Methods This population-based cohort analysis included all term singleton deliveries between 1991 and 2014. The study population was divided into two study group: elective cesarean deliveries (CD) versus vaginal deliveries (VD). Urgent cesarean deliveries, pregnancy, and delivery complications including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes were excluded. The evaluation of cumulative neurological hospitalization rate over time was performed with a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the independent association between mode of delivery and neurological morbidity while controlling for potential confounders. Results During the study period 132,054 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, 11,746 CD (8.9%), and 120,308 (91.1%) VD. A total of 3,626 neurological hospitalizations were documented with 2.70% (3,244) in the VD group as compared with 3.25% (382) in the CD group. The survival curves showed higher cumulative hospitalization rates in the CD as compared with the VD group ( p 0.001). The Cox analysis demonstrated CD to be an independent risk factor for pediatric neurological hospitalizations ( p <0.001). Conclusion Term elective CD is an independent risk factor for neurological morbidity of the offspring.","[Baumfeld, Yael; Sheiner, Eyal; Walfisch, Asnat] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Soroka Univ Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Wainstock, Tamar; Sergienko, Ruslan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Segal, Idit] Minist Hlth, Jerusalem, Israel; [Landau, Daniella] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Soroka Univ Med Ctr, Dept Neonatol, Beer Sheva, Israel",,,2,SEP,2018,35,11,10.1055/s-0038-1637001,Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics

Understanding racial differences in the gut microbiota and related covariates (e.g., stress) may yield new insight into unexplained colorectal cancer disparities. Methods Healthy non-Hispanic black or white women (age 19 years) provided survey data, anthropometrics, and stool samples. Fecal DNA was collected and isolated from a wipe. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the V4 region of the 16SrRNA gene and 250 bases were sequenced using the MiSeq platform. Microbiome data were analyzed using QIIME. Operational taxonomic unit data were log transformed and normalized. Analyses were conducted using linear models in R Package limma. Results Fecal samples were analyzed for 80 women (M (SD) age = 39.9 (14.0) years, 47 black, 33 white). Blacks had greater average body mass index (33.3 versus 27.5 kg/m(2), p < .01) and waist circumference (98.3 versus 86.6 cm, p = .003) than whites. Whites reported more stressful life events (p = .026) and greater distress (p = .052) than blacks. Final models accounted for these differences. There were no significant differences in dietary variables. Unadjusted comparisons revealed no racial differences in alpha diversity. Racial differences were observed in beta diversity and abundance of top 10 operational taxonomic units. Blacks had higher abundances than whites of Faecalibacterium (p = .034) and Bacteroides (p = .038). Stress was associated with abundances of Bifidobacterium. The association between race and Bacteroides (logFC = 1.72, 0 = 0.020) persisted in fully adjusted models. Conclusions Racial differences in the gut microbiota were observed including higher Bacteroides among blacks.

Antipsychotic drugs generally target the dopamine pathways with some variation. As research of schizophrenia pathophysiology has shifted away from a strictly dopamine-centric focus, the development of new pharmacotherapies has waned. A field of inquiry with centuries-old roots is gaining traction in psychiatric research circles and may represent a new frontier for drug discovery in schizophrenia. At the forefront of this investigative effort is the immune system and its many components, pathways and phenotypes, which are now known to actively engage the brain. Studies in schizophrenia reveal an intricate association of environmentally-driven immune activation in concert with a disrupted genetic template. A consistent conduit through this gene-environmental milieu is the gut-brain axis, which when dysregulated can generate pathological autoimmunity. In this review, we present epidemiological and biochemical evidence in support of an autoimmune component in schizophrenia and depict gut processes and a dysbiotic microbiome as a source and perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction in the brain. Within this framework, we review the role of infectious agents, inflammation, gut dysbioses and autoantibody propagation on CNS pathologies such as neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction and complement pathway-mediated synaptic pruning. We then review the new pharmacotherapeutic horizon and novel agents directed to impact these pathological conditions. At the core of this discourse is the understanding that schizophrenia is etiologically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous and thus its treatment requires individualized attention with disease state variants diagnosed with objective biomarkers.

Certain commentators argue that Capitalocene better characterizes the situation, given that the effects of planetary decimation and global warming are not equally distributed among humans. A second conceptual change has recently taken place in which genomes are recognized as reactive to environmental stimuli both external and internal to the human body. In the post-genomic era, genes neither initiate life nor drive human development. The science of the bourgeoning field of behavioural epigenetics is introduced, followed by illustrative examples of environmentally caused epigenetic changes that impact negatively on health. Epigeneticists routinely delimit their attention to detecting measurable changes at the molecular level. It is argued that anthropological contributions that incorporate subjective accounts of embodiment involving past and present events are crucial in order to better situate and account for biological differences and health outcomes historically, ecologically, and politically. Discussion of the microbiome provides a cautionary reminder that microbes are the ultimate driving force of health and illness. In conclusion, the Earth Optimism movement is briefly introduced, as is the concept of resilience, but alone these positive moves will not curb unremitting global warming.","[Lock, Margaret] McGill Univ, Dept Social Studies Med, 3647 Peel St, Montreal, PQ H3A 1X1, Canada",,,2,SEP,2018,24,3,10.1111/1467-9655.12855,Anthropology

The recent rapid development of technology to perform high throughput DNA sequencing has expanded this view to include the study of entire microbial communities. Applying the One Health approach to the microbiome allows for consideration of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbial transfer between humans, animals, and the environment. We review recent research studies of such transmission, the molecular and statistical methods being used, and the implications of such microbiome relationships for human health. Our review identified evidence that the environmental microbiome as well as the microbiome of animals in close contact can affect both the human microbiome and human health outcomes. Such microbiome transfer can take place in the household as well as the workplace setting. Urbanization of built environments leads to changes in the environmental microbiome which could be a factor in human health. While affected by environmental exposures, the human microbiome also can modulate the response to environmental factors through effects on metabolic and immune function. Better understanding of these microbiome interactions between humans, animals, and the shared environment will require continued development of improved statistical and ecological modeling approaches. Such enhanced understanding could lead to innovative interventions to prevent and manage a variety of human health and disease states.","[Trinh, Pauline; Rabinowitz, Peter M.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zaneveld, Jesse R.] Univ Washington, Div Biol Sci, Sch Sci Technol Educ & Math, Bothell, WA USA; [Safranek, Sarah] Univ Washington, Hlth Sci Lib, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington Biostatistics, Epidemiologic, and Bioinformatic Training in Environmental Health [NIEHS 5T32ES015459-08]","This work was sponsored (in whole or in part) by University of Washington Biostatistics, Epidemiologic, and Bioinformatic Training in Environmental Health, grant no: NIEHS 5T32ES015459-08.",4,Aug-30,2018,6,,10.3389/fpubh.2018.00235,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In recent years, animal welfare scientists have embraced cognitive sciences to rise to the challenge of determining an animal's internal state in order to better understand its welfare needs and by extension, the needs of larger groups of animals. A wide range of cognitive tests have been developed that can be applied in farmed species to assess a range of cognitive traits. However, this has also presented challenges. Whilst it may be expected to see cognitive variation at the species level, differences in cognitive ability between and within individuals of the same species have frequently been noted but left largely unexplained. Not accounting for individual variation may result in misleading conclusions when the results are applied both at an individual level and at higher levels of scale. This has implications both for our fundamental understanding of an individual's welfare needs, but also more broadly for experimental design and the justification for sample sizes in studies using animals. We urgently need to address this issue. In this review, we will consider the latest developments on the causes of individual variation in cognitive outcomes, such as the choice of cognitive test, sex, breed, age, early life environment, rearing conditions, personality, diet, and the animal's microbiome. We discuss the impact of each of these factors specifically in relation to recent work in farmed species, and explore the future directions for cognitive research in this field, particularly in relation to experimental design and analytical techniques that allow individual variation to be accounted for appropriately.","[Bushby, Emily V.; Friel, Mary; Goold, Conor; Gray, Helen; Smith, Lauren; Collins, Lisa M.] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","BBSRC iCase PhD studentship; Global Food Security Food Systems Resilience (GFS-FSR) programme, through the PigSustain grant [BB/N020790/1]; Vier Pfoten International PhD studentship; GFS-FSR [BB/N020790/1]","EB is funded by a BBSRC iCase PhD studentship; LS is funded by a Vier Pfoten International PhD studentship; MF, CG, and HG are funded by the Global Food Security Food Systems Resilience (GFS-FSR) programme, through the PigSustain grant (BB/N020790/1); LC is funded in part by a GFS-FSR grant (BB/N020790/1).",1,Aug-17,2018,5,,10.3389/fvets.2018.00193,Veterinary Sciences

Although ASD is most widely identified by its neurological deficits, gastrointestinal issues are common in ASD. An intimate and complex relationship exists between the gut, the immune system, and the brain, leading to the hypothesis that ASD may be a systems-level disease affecting the gut and immune systems, in addition to the brain. Despite significant advances in understanding the contribution of the gut and immune systems to the etiology of ASD, there is an intriguing commonality among patients that is not well understood: they are predominantly male. Virtually no attention has been given to the potential role of sex specific regulation of gut, peripheral, and central immune function in ASD, despite the 4:1 male-to female bias in this disorder.

The biological mechanisms that accompany individuals with autism are reviewed in this manuscript including immune system dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic and methylation abnormalities as well as gastrointestinal distress. We propose that these autism-associated biological mechanisms may be caused and/or sustained by dysbiosis, an alteration to the composition of resident commensal communities relative to the community found in healthy individuals and its redox and epigenetic consequences, changes that in part can be due to early use and over-use of antibiotics across generations.

In this review, the interactions between gut microbiota and the host have been focused on, to provide an overview of the role of gut microbiota and their unique metabolites in conferring host protection against invading pathogen, regulation of diverse host physiological functions including metabolism, development and homeostasis of immunity and the nervous system. We elaborate on how gut microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) may lead to dysfunction of host machineries, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and/or progression toward a broad spectrum of diseases. Some of the most notable diseases namely Clostridium difficile infection (infectious disease), inflammatory bowel disease (intestinal immune-mediated disease), celiac disease (multisystemic autoimmune disorder), obesity (metabolic disease), colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder (neuropsychiatric disorder) have been discussed and delineated along with recent findings. Novel therapies derived from microbiome studies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotic and prebiotics to target associated diseases have been reviewed to introduce the idea of how certain disease symptoms can be ameliorated through dysbiosis correction, thus revealing a new scientific approach toward disease treatment. Toward the end of this review, several research gaps and limitations have been described along with suggested future studies to overcome the current research lacunae. Despite the ongoing debate on whether gut microbiome plays a role in the above-mentioned diseases, we have in this review, gathered evidence showing a potentially far more complex link beyond the unidirectional cause-and-effect relationship between them.","[Kho, Zhi Y.; Lal, Sunil K.] Monash Univ, Sch Sci, Trop Med & Biol Platform, Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Tropical Medicine and Biology Platform,This publication was supported by funding from the Tropical Medicine and Biology Platform.,46,Aug-14,2018,9,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.01835,Microbiology

Currently, there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for these core symptoms. This article reviews the biological origins of the social function deficit associated with autism spectrum disorder and the drug therapies with the potential to treat this deficit. A review of the history of autism demonstrates that a deficit in social interaction has been the defining feature of the concept of autism from its conception. Abnormalities identified in early social skill development and an overview of the pathophysiology abnormalities associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed as are the abnormalities in brain circuits associated with the social function deficit. Previous and ongoing clinical trials examining agents that have the potential to improve social deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed in detail. This discussion reveals that agents such as oxytocin and propranolol are particularly promising and undergoing active investigation, while other agents such as vasopressin agonists and antagonists are being activity investigated but have limited published evidence at this time.

The largest collection of these microorganisms is found in the gastrointestinal tract. Microbial composition reflects both genetic and lifestyle variables of the host. This microbiota is in a dynamic balance with the host, exerting local and distant effects. Microbial perturbation (dysbiosis) could contribute to the risk of developing health problems. Various bacterial genes capable of producing estrogen-metabolizing enzymes have been identified. Accordingly, gut microbiota is capable of modulating estrogen serum levels. Conversely, estrogen-like compounds may promote the proliferation of certain species of bacteria. Therefore, a crosstalk between microbiota and both endogenous hormones and estrogen-like compounds might synergize to provide protection from disease but also to increase the risk of developing hormone-related diseases. Recent research suggests that the microbiota of women with breast cancer differs from that of healthy women, indicating that certain bacteria may be associated with cancer development and with different responses to therapy. In this review, we discuss recent knowledge about the microbiome and breast cancer, identifying specific characteristics of the human microbiome that may serve to develop novel approaches for risk assessment, prevention and treatment for this disease.","[Fernandez, Mariana F.; Manuel Astorga, Juan; Rodriguez-Carrillo, Andrea] Univ Granada, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Fernandez, Mariana F.; Manuel Astorga, Juan; Rodriguez-Carrillo, Andrea] Univ Granada, Biomed Res Ctr, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Fernandez, Mariana F.; Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Fontana, Luis] Hlth Res Inst Granada Ibs GRANADA, Granada 18010, Spain; [Fernandez, Mariana F.; Reina-Perez, Iris] Spanish Consortium Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBE, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Fontana, Luis] Univ Granada, Sch Pharm, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol 2, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Plaza-Diaz, Julio; Fontana, Luis] Univ Granada, Biomed Res Ctr, Inst Nutr & Food Technol Jose Mataix, Parque Tecnol Ciencias Salud, Granada 18100, Spain","Junta de Andalucia, SpainJunta de Andalucia [PI-0538-2017]","Ongoing research is funded by grant PI-0538-2017, Junta de Andalucia, Spain (to LF).

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been reported to have therapeutic effects on diseases related to dysbiosis, but few studies have evaluated its effect on psychiatric symptoms. Methods: We followed 17 patients with either Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Functional Diarrhea (FDr) or Functional Constipation (FC) who underwent FMT for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms and observation of psychiatric symptoms. Changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and subscale of sleep-related items, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) between baseline and 4 weeks after FMT, and relationship with the intestinal microbiota were measured. Results: At baseline, 12 out of 17 patients were rated with HAM-D >= 8. Significant improvement in HAM-D total and sleep subscale score, HAM-A and QIDS were observed (p = 0.007, p = 0.007, p = 0.01, p = 0.007, respectively). Baseline Shannon index indicated that microbiota showed lower diversity in patients with HAM-D >= 8 compared to those of healthy donors and patients with HAM-D < 8. There was a significant correlation between baseline Shannon index and HAM-D score, and a correlation between Shannon index change and HAM-D improvement after FMT. Limitations: The small sample size with no control group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that depression and anxiety symptoms may be improved by FMT regardless of gastrointestinal symptom change in patients with IBS, FDr and FC, and the increase of microbiota diversity may help to improve patient's mood.","[Kurokawa, Shunya; Kishimoto, Taishiro; Liang, Kuo-ching; Mimura, Masaru] Keio Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizuno, Shinta; Masaoka, Tatsuhiro; Naganuma, Makoto; Nakashima, Moeko; Kanai, Takanori] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kitazawa, Momoko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Tokyo, Japan; [Suda, Wataru] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci, Lab Microbiome Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Shindo, Chie; Suda, Wataru; Hattori, Masahira] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Lab Metagen, Chiba, Japan; [Shindo, Chie; Hattori, Masahira] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan",Health and Labor Sciences Research Grants for research on intractable diseases from the Japanese Ministry of Health; Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF); Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds;  [25460301];  [17K15966],"This study was supported in part by Health and Labor Sciences Research Grants for research on intractable diseases from the Japanese Ministry of Health(T.

Nutrition, at all stages of life, plays an important role in determining health and wellbeing. MethodsA roundtable meeting of UK experts on nutrition and ageing considered key aspects of the diet-ageing relationship and developed a consensus position on the main priorities for research and public health actions that are required to help people live healthier lives as they age. ResultsThe group consensus highlighted the requirement for a life course approach, recognising the multifactorial nature of the impact of ageing. Environmental and lifestyle influences at any life stage are modified by genetic factors and early development. The response to the environment at each stage of life can determine the impact of lifestyle later on. There are no key factors that act in isolation to determine patterns of ageing and it is a combination of environmental and social factors that drives healthy or unhealthy ageing. Too little is known about how contemporary dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles will impact upon healthy ageing in future generations and this is a priority for future research. ConclusionsThere is good evidence to support change to lifestyle (i.e. diet, nutrition and physical) activity in relation to maintaining or improving body composition, cognitive health and emotional intelligence, immune function and vascular health. Lifestyle change at any stage of life may extend healthy lifespan, although the impact of early changes appears to be greatest.","[Calder, P.

This association stems from the recently characterised bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain, mediated by neuroimmune, neuroendocrine and sensory neural pathways. While the link between gut microbiome and depression is well supported by research, a major question needing to be addressed is the causality in the connection between the two, which will support the understanding of the role that the gut microbiota play in depression. In this article, we address this question by examining a theoretical 'chronology', reviewing the evidence supporting two possible sequences of events. First, we discuss that alterations in the gut microbiota populations of specific species might contribute to depression, and secondly, that depressive states might induce modification of specific gut microbiota species and eventually contribute to more severe depression. The feasibility of both sequences is supported by pre-clinical trials. For instance, research in rodents has shown an onset of depressive behaviour following faecal transplantations from patients with MDD. On the other hand, mental induction of stress and depressive behaviour in rodents resulted in reduced gut microbiota richness and diversity. Synthesis of these chronology dynamics raises important research directions to further understand the role that gut microbiota play in mood-relating behaviours, which holds substantial potential clinical outcomes for persons who experience MDD or related depressive disorders.","[Winter, Gal; Hart, Robert A.; Charlesworth, Richard P.

The gut microbiota may buffer changes in energy demands, with shifts in community composition increasing the energy production potential of the gut during pregnancy and lactation. In this study, we examine changes in the gut microbiome of wild, female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across different reproductive states. Fecal samples (n=39) were collected from five adult females over the course of a year. Gut microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequences, and PICRUSt was used to make metagenomic functional predictions. We found a significant relationship between reproductive state and both the structure and predicted function of the gut microbiome, neither of which were associated with host diet. For example, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in lactating females compared with cycling females; the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly higher in pregnant females compared with lactating females, and there was a trend toward higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria in pregnant females compared with cycling females. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to behavioral and dietary adaptions, the gut microbiota may play a role in allowing female primates to meet their changing energetic needs during reproduction. Further studies of the microbial reproductive ecology of primates will help advance our understanding of gut microbial contributions to primate energetics.","[Mallott, Elizabeth K.; Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, 1810 Hinman Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; Graduate Research Fellowship Program, National Science Foundation; Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Northwestern University; Center for Latin American Studies, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Research, American Philosophical Society","Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; Graduate Research Fellowship Program, National Science Foundation; Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Northwestern University; Center for Latin American Studies, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Research, American Philosophical Society",7,AUG,2018,80,8,10.1002/ajp.22896,Zoology

Compared with human milk, infant formula tends to have a higher protein content and is associated with greater weight gain and later-in-life obesity risk. However, the effect of protein from other sources on infant growth trajectories during complementary feeding is not clear. Emerging research suggests that meat protein during early complementary feeding promotes linear growth while not increasing risk of overweight compared with dairy protein; and the gut microbiota might be a mediator between protein quality and growth trajectories.

Nonetheless, the influence of this digestible diet on gut microbial contributions to aye-aye metabolism and nutrition remains unexplored. When four captive aye-ayes were unexpectedly lost to persin toxicity, we opportunistically collected samples along the animals' gastrointestinal tracts. Here we describe the diversity and composition of appendicular, cecal, and colonic consortia relative to the aye-aye's unusual feeding ecology. Materials and methodsDuring necropsies, we collected digestive content from the appendix, cecum, and distal colon. We determined microbiome structure at these sites via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and an established bioinformatics pipeline. ResultsThe aye-ayes' microbiomes exhibited low richness and diversity compared to the consortia of other lemurs housed at the same facility, and were dominated by a single genus, Prevotella. Appendicular microbiomes were differentiated from more homogenized cecal and colonic consortia by lower richness and diversity, greater evenness, and a distinct taxonomic composition. DiscussionThe simplicity of the aye-aye's gut microbiome could be attributed to captivity-induced dysbiosis, or it may reflect this species' extreme foraging investment in a digestible diet that requires little microbial metabolism. Site-specific appendicular consortia, but more similar cecal and colonic consortia, support the theory that the appendix functions as a safe-house for beneficial bacteria, and confirm fecal communities as fairly reliable proxies for consortia along the lower gut.

Also common is the exposure of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States to antibiotics, especially during the peripartum period. Antibiotic exposure is known to alter gut microbial composition and structure, contributing to a dysbiotic, or imbalanced gut microbiome, and is a mechanism suggested for the increased risk of depressive symptoms following antibiotic exposure in non-pregnant, non-postpartum populations. We sought to determine the relationship between antibiotic exposure intrapartum through the first 14 days postpartum and depressive symptoms within the first 6-months postpartum. In this secondary data analysis, 124 pregnant women from a prospective cohort were enrolled into the study and provided demographic characteristics and health history. Participants completed questionnaires including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale between 32-36 weeks, and 1- and 2-weeks and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-months postpartum. Clinical measures including hours in labor, perineal injury, and mode of giving birth were ascertained by medical record abstraction. Antibiotic exposure was identified by self-report at 1- and 2-weeks postpartum. Antibiotic exposure was found to be independently predictive of postpartum depressive symptoms at 1-month (Beta=0.43; CI [0.01, 0.86]) and 2-months (Beta=0.51; CI [0.08, 0.94]) postpartum after controlling for baseline predictors. The relationship between antibiotic exposure and postpartum depressive symptoms did not maintain significance at 3- or 6-months postpartum.

There can be many reasons for elevated prenatal stress, as in communities at war. There may be raised pregnancy-specific anxiety with high levels of maternal and infant death. There can be raised interpersonal violence (in Afghanistan 90.2% of women thought that ""wife beating"" was justified compared with 2.0% in Argentina). There may be interactions with nutritional deficiencies or with extremes of temperature. Prenatal stress alters the microbiome, and this can differ in different countries. Genetic differences in different ethnic groups may make some more vulnerable or more resilient to the effects of prenatal stress on child neurodevelopment. Most research on these questions has been in predominantly Caucasian samples from high-income countries. It is now time to understand more about prenatal stress and psychopathology, and the role of both social and biological differences, in the rest of the world.","[Glover, Vivette] Imperial Coll London, Du Cane Rd, London W12 ONN, England; [O'Donnell, Kieran J.] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [O'Donnell, Kieran J.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [O'Connor, Thomas G.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Fisher, Jane] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",,,9,AUG,2018,30,3,10.1017/S095457941800038X,"Psychology, Developmental"

BackgroundWound care procedures such as dressing changes can cause moderate to severe pain in 74% of patients, with nearly half (36%) of all patients experiencing severe pain (rated as 8-10 on a 10-point numeric rating scale) during dressing change. Additionally, clinicians have little direction with current guidelines regarding pain control during WCPs including the selection of the appropriate advanced wound dressings and the appropriate use of analgesics. DesignThis is a cross-sectional study. MethodsThe National Institute of Nursing Research approved and funded the study June of 2015 and the appropriate Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols prior to funding. Study enrolment is underway at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with a target of 525 participants. Potential participants must be adults (21+years) and have a nonburn, nondiabetic foot, full-thickness wound. The research team performs a one-time study dressing change on enrolled participants and collects all study data. DiscussionThis study will allow the development of a tool for clinicians to use to predict severe pain during WCPs and identify biological factors significantly associated with severe pain during WCPs.","[Fiala, Catherine A.; Abbott, Linda I.; Carter, Cheryl D.; Wolf, Jessica S.; Schuster, Meghan; Dulski, Rachel; Rakel, Barbara A.; Gardner, Sue E.] Univ Iowa, Coll Nursing, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Abbott, Linda I.] Univ Iowa Hosp & Clin, Dept Nursing, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Hillis, Stephen L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Radiol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Hillis, Stephen L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA USA; [Grice, Elizabeth A.] Univ Penn, Dept Dermatol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",NIH/NINRUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R01NR015642],This study received funding from NIH/NINR R01NR015642,0,AUG,2018,74,8,10.1111/jan.13699,Nursing

However, growing evidence suggests that behaviour may concurrently be influenced by infectious microorganisms. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii infects an estimated 2 billion people worldwide and has been linked to behavioural alterations in humans and other vertebrates. Here we integrate primary data from college students and business professionals with national-level information on cultural attitudes towards business to test the hypothesis that T. gondii infection influences individual- as well as societal-scale entrepreneurship activities. Using a saliva-based assay, we found that students (n = 1495) who tested IgG positive for T. gondii exposure were 1.4 x more likely to major in business and 1.7x more likely to have an emphasis in 'management and entrepreneurship' over other business-related emphases. Among professionals attending entrepreneurship events, T. gondii-positive individuals were 1.8x more likely to have started their own business compared with other attendees (n = 197). Finally, after synthesizing and combining country-level databases on T. gondii infection from the past 25 years with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor of entrepreneurial activity, we found that infection prevalence was a consistent, positive predictor of entrepreneurial activity and intentions at the national scale, regardless of whether previously identified economic covariati.ss were included. Nations with higher infection also had a lower fraction of respondents citing 'fear of failure' in inhibiting new business ventures. While correlational, these results highlight the linkage between parasitic infection and complex human behaviours, including those relevant to business, entrepreneurship and economic productivity.","[Johnson, Stefanie K.; Beldon, Marissa A.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Calhoun, Dana M.; Johnson, Pieter T.

However, little is known about the dietary intake and nutritional status of pregnant women residing in urban South Africa. Therefore, the Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development (NuPED) cohort study was initiated to assess early nutrition-related exposures predictive of early childhood development in urban South Africa. Methods: The aims of this prospective cohort study are: 1) to assess dietary intake and nutritional status of urban pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa, and 2) to determine associations with birth outcomes, measures of maternal health, as well as measures of offspring health and development. Pregnant women (< 18 weeks' gestation) (n = 250) are being recruited from primary healthcare clinics in Johannesburg and are followed-up at a provincial hospital. Participants' dietary intake and nutrient status (focus on micronutrients and fatty acids) are assessed at < 18, 22 and 36 weeks' gestation. Additional assessments during pregnancy include anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, obstetric ultrasound screens, and assessments of food security, maternal fatigue, prenatal depression, allergy, immune function, morbidity and gestational diabetes. At birth, maternal and neonatal health is assessed and an umbilical cord blood sample collected. Maternal and offspring health is followed-up at 6 weeks, as well as at 6, approximate to 7.5 and 12 months after birth. Follow-up assessments of mothers include anthropometric measures, diet history, nutrient status, blood pressure, breast milk composition, and measures of postnatal depression and fatigue. Follow-up assessments of the offspring include feeding practices, nutrient status, measures of growth, psychomotor, socio-emotional and immune development, morbidity, allergy, as well as analysis of the gut microbiome and the epigenome. Discussion: Ensuring adequate nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key actions endorsed by the South African Government to promote optimal early childhood development in an effort to eradicate poverty. The results from this study may serve as a basis for the development of context-specific nutritional interventions which can improve birth outcomes and long-term quality of life of the mother and her offspring.","[Symington, Elizabeth A.; Baumgartner, Jeannine; Malan, Linda; Zandberg, Lizelle; Ricci, Cristian; Smuts, Cornelius M.] North West Univ, Ctr Excellence Nutr, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Symington, Elizabeth A.] Univ South Africa, Dept Life & Consumer Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [99374]; South African Medical Research Council; University of South Africa's Research Department,"This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa for the grant, Unique Grant No. 99374 and the South African Medical Research Council under a Self-Initiated Research Grant.

Methods: Thus, the present study aimed to define the characteristics of gut microbiota in treatment-naive children with ADHD and to assess their relationship with the severity of ADHD symptoms. High-throughput pyrosequencing was used to investigate the microbiota composition in fecal matter from 51 children with ADHD and 32 healthy controls (HC). Results: An operational taxonomical unit (OTU)-level analysis revealed a significant decrease in the fractional representation of Faecalibacterium in children with ADHD compared to HC. In individuals with ADHD, the abundance of Faecalibacterium was negatively associated with parental reports of ADHD symptoms. However, there was no significant difference in alpha diversity between the ADHD and control groups. Conclusions: This present findings support the involvement of microbiota alteration in psychiatric diseases and Faecalibacterium may represent a potential novel marker of gut microbiota in ADHD. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and to elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between these variables.","[Jiang, Hai-yin; Li, Yu-chuan; Ruan, Bing] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 1,State Key Lab Diag & Treatment, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuan-yue; Zhou, Guo-ling] Hangzhou Seventh Peoples Hosp, Dept Child Psychiat, Hangzhou 310013, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jing; Li, Xiao-he] Third Peoples Hosp Shenzhen, Dept Liver Dis, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81601186]; National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform [2005DKA21300],This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81601186) and National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform (Grant No. 2005DKA21300).,8,Jul-16,2018,347,,10.1016/j.bbr.2018.03.036,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences

It has been shown that microbiota play a pivotal role in this process and affect central neurochemistry and behavior. Disruption of or alterations in the intimate cross-talk between microbiome and brain may be a significant factor in many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in the composition of the microbiome, so called dysbiosis, may result in detrimental distortion of microbe-host homeostasis modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A variety of pathologies are associated with changes in the community structure and function of the gut microbiota, suggesting a link between dysbiosis and disease etiology, including irritable bowel syndrome depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and alcoholism. Despite a paucity of clinical studies in alcohol-dependent humans, emerging data suggests that alohol induced alterations of the microbiome may explain reward-seeking behaviors as well as anxiety, depression, and craving in withdrawal and increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders.","[Hillemacher, Thomas] Paracelsus Med Univ Nuremberg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Nurnberg, Germany; [Bachmann, Oliver] Hannover Med Sch MHH, Dept Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endocrinol, Hannover, Germany; [Bachmann, Oliver] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Partner Site Hannover Braunschweig, Hannover, Germany; [Hillemacher, Thomas; Kahl, Kai G.; Frieling, Helge] Hannover Med Sch MHH, Dept Psychiat Social Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Hannover, Germany",,,11,Jul-13,2018,85,,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.04.015,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry

Due to recent findings of microbial involvement in other psychiatric disorders like autism and depression, a role of the gut microbiota in ADHD pathogenesis is assumed but has not yet been investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of 14 male ADHD patients (mean age: 11.9 yrs.) and 17 male controls (mean age: 13.1 yrs.) was examined via next generation sequencing of 16S rDNA and analyzed for diversity and biomarkers. We found that the microbial diversity (alpha diversity) was significantly decreased in ADHD patients compared to controls (p(shannon) = 0.036) and that the composition (beta diversity) differed significantly between patients and controls (P-ANOSIM = 0.033, P-ADONIS = 0.006, P-betadisper = 0.002). In detail, the bacterial family Prevotellacae was associated with controls, while patients with ADHD showed elevated levels of Bacteroidaceae, and both Neisseriaceae and Neisseria spec. were found as possible biomarkers for juvenile ADHD. Our results point to a possible link of certain microbiota with ADHD, with Neisseria spec. being a very promising ADHD-associated candidate. This finding provides the basis for a systematic, longitudinal assessment of the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD, yielding promising potential for both prevention and therapeutic intervention.","[Prehn-Kristensen, Alexander; Zimmermann, Alexandra; Baving, Lioba] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Ctr Integrat Psychiat, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Kiel, Germany; [Zimmermann, Alexandra; Tittmann, Lukas; Schreiber, Stefan; Fischer, Annegret] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Clin Mol Biol, Kiel, Germany; [Lieb, Wolfgang] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Epidemiol, Kiel, Germany; [Schreiber, Stefan] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Clin Internal Med 1, Kiel, Germany",medical faculty of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein,"This study was funded by an intramural grant of the medical faculty of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein.; We thank Michaela Hilgert, Dr. Gunnar Jacobs, Susanne Kell, and Petra Schneckenburger for their technical support and Dr. Manuel Munz for his medical support.

Additionally, as humans are cooperative breeders and, throughout our evolutionary history and today, we rear offspring within social networks, we examine associations between the social environment and the HMM. Childrearing and breastfeeding exist in a biosocial nexus, which we hypothesize influences the HMM. MethodsMilk samples from hunter-gatherer and horticultural mothers (n=41) collected over two seasons, were analyzed for their microbial composition. A subsample of these women's infants (n=33) also participated in detailed naturalistic behavioral observations which identified the breadth of infants' social and caregiving networks and the frequency of contact they had with caregivers. ResultsAnalyses of milk produced by CAR women indicated that HMM diversity and community composition were related to the size of the mother-infant dyad's social network and frequency of care that infants receive. The abundance of some microbial taxa also varied significantly across populations and seasons. Alpha diversity, however, was not related to subsistence type or seasonality. ConclusionWhile the origins of the HMM are not fully understood, our results provide evidence regarding possible feedback loops among the infant, the mother, and the mother's social network that might influence HMM composition.","[Meehan, Courtney L.; Hagen, Edward H.; Roulette, Jennifer; Helfrecht, Courtney] Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Lackey, Kimberly A.; McGuire, Michelle K.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Williams, Janet E.; McGuire, Mark A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [McGuire, Michelle K.] Washington State Univ, Paul G Allen Sch Global Anim Hlth, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","NSF CAREER Award (BCS) [9055213]; College of Arts and Sciences; Initiative for Global Innovation Studies; Elling Fund at Washington State University; Health Equity Research Center, a strategic research initiative of Washington State University","Special thanks to the mothers and infants, the Ministere de l'Education Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique et de la Technologie in the CAR, and the field crews.

In this study, we first compared the difference of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored whether gut microbiota can be used as a biomarker to assist in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We restricted inclusion criteria strictly to control confounding bias. Finally, we investigated differences in fecal microbiota between 64 schizophrenia patients and 53 healthy controls. At the phylum level, we found that the abundance of Proteobacteria in the schizophrenia patients was significantly increased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio, Megasphaera, Collinsella, Clostridium, Klebsiella and Methanobrevibacter was significantly higher whereas the abundance of Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia was decreased compared to health controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that 12 significant microbiota biomarkers were capable of being used as diagnostic factors for distinguishing the schizophrenia cohort from those in the control cohort (AUC=0.837). We performed PICRUSt analysis and found that several metabolic pathways differed significantly between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, including vitamin B6 and fatty acid. In conclusion, there are some difference of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls and the insights from this study could be used to develop microbiota-based diagnosis for schizophrenia.

This is associated with the development of geriatric syndromes including sarcopenia and frailty. Dietary protein is essential for skeletal muscle function. Resistance exercise appears to be the most beneficial form of physical activity for preserving skeletal muscle and a synergistic effect has been noted when this is combined with dietary protein. However, older adults have shown evidence of anabolic resistance, where greater amounts of protein are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and response is variable. Thus, the recommended daily amount of protein is greater for older people. The aetiologies and mechanisms responsible for anabolic resistance are not fully understood. The gut microbiota is implicated in many of the postulated mechanisms for anabolic resistance, either directly or indirectly. The gut microbiota change with age, and are influenced by dietary protein. Research also implies a role for the gut microbiome in skeletal muscle function. This leads to the hypothesis that the gut microbiome might modulate individual response to protein in the diet. We summarise the existing evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in anabolic resistance and skeletal muscle in aging people, and introduce the metabolome as a tool to probe this relationship in the future.","[Ni Lochlainn, Mary; Bowyer, Ruth C.

The inflammation source is not known but may be the result of dysbiotic processes occurring in the gut. We examined peripheral biomarkers of bacterial translocation, soluble CD14 (sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and of general inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP), in a unique, pre-onset study of schizophrenia. This sample was composed of 80 case-control matched pairs of US military service members from whom blood samples were obtained at time of entry to service, before a psychiatric diagnosis was made. Elevated levels of sCD14 in individuals who were subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia generated odds ratios of 1.22 for association with disease (p < 0.02). Conversely, LBP levels for those who developed schizophrenia were unchanged or very marginally decreased compared to controls (p = 0.06). No significant changes were found for CRP in schizophrenia compared with their matched controls. This diversity of patterns suggests that a dysregulated immune system is present prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In particular, sCD14 elevation and discordant LBP decrease in cases support a more generalized monocyte activation rather than a specific translocation of gut bacteria into circulation. The corresponding absence of general inflammation as measured by CRP may indicate that this monocyte activation or related immune dysfunction precedes the early inflammatory stage frequently evident in schizophrenia.

We studied cage-within-cage resident-intruder all-male model, where subject male mice (C57BL/6J) are exposed to aggressor mice (SJL albino), and gut microbiota-derived metabolites were identified in plasma after 10 days of exposure. We assessed 16S ribosomal RNA gene from fecal samples collected daily from these mice during the 10-day study. Alpha diversity using Chao indices indicated no change in diversity in aggressor-exposed samples. The abundance profile showed the top phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, respectively. The phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are vulnerable to PTSD-eliciting stress and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio increases with stress. Principal coordinate analysis showed the control and aggressor-exposed samples cluster separately where samples from early time points (day 1-3) clustered together and were distinct from late time points (day 4-9). The genus-based analysis revealed all control time points clustered together and aggressor-exposed samples had multiple clusters. The decrease in proportion of Firmicutes after aggressor exposure persisted throughout the study. The proportion of Verrucomicrobia immediately decreased and was significantly shifted at most of the later time points. The genus Oscillospira, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia and Anaeroplasma are the top four genera that differed between control and stressor-exposed mice. The data showed immediate effect on microbiome composition during a 10 day time period of stress exposure. Studying the longitudinal effects of a stressor is an important step toward an improved mechanistic understanding of the microbiome dynamics.","[Gautam, Aarti; Kumar, Raina; Chakraborty, Nabarun; Muhie, Seid; Hoke, Allison; Hammamieh, Rasha; Jett, Marti] US Army Ctr Environm Hlth Res, 568 Doughten Dr, Ft Detrick, MD 21702 USA; [Kumar, Raina] Adv Biomed Comp Ctr, Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, Frederick, MD USA; [Chakraborty, Nabarun; Muhie, Seid] Geneva Fdn, Ft Detrick, MD USA; [Hoke, Allison] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Ft Detrick, MD USA",USAMRMCU.S. Army Medical Research & Materiel Command (USAMRMC) [09284002],"The support from USAMRMC, grant number 09284002 is gratefully acknowledged",11,JUL,2018,96,7,10.1002/jnr.24229,Neurosciences

Recently, it has been proposed that dental calculus may provide a more robust environment for DNA preservation than other skeletal remains, but this has not been systematically tested. In this study, shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08 +/- 0.08%, range 0.007-0.47%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70 +/- 18.62%, range 0.003-70.14%), and for a subset of dentin samples (15.21%), oral bacteria contribute > 20% of total DNA. Human DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA fragmentation patterns are associated with guaninecytosine (GC) content, but not aspects of cellular structure.","[Mann, Allison E.; Sabin, Susanna; Vagene, Ashild J.; Yates, James A.

Yet 80% of infections never progress to clinical disease. Decades of research have generated an interconnected network linking pathogen, host, and environmental factors to disease expression, but the relative importance of these and whether they account for disease progression remains unknown. To address this, we used structural equation modeling to evaluate putative factors likely to contribute to urogenital and ocular chlamydial disease in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). These factors include Chlamydia detection, load, and ompA genotype; urogenital and ocular microbiomes; host sex, age, weight, body condition; breading season, time of year; location; retrovirus co-infection; and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) alleles. We show different microbiological processes underpin disease progression at urogenital and ocular sites. From each category of factors, urogenital disease was most strongly predicted by chlamydial PCR detection and load, koala body condition and environmental location. In contrast, ocular disease was most strongly predicted by phylum-level Chlamydiae microbiome proportions, sampling during breeding season and co-infection with koala retrovirus subtype B. Host MHCII alleles also contributed predictive power to both disease models. Our results also show considerable uncertainty remains, suggesting major causal mechanisms are yet to be discovered.","[Quigley, Bonnie L.; Vidgen, Miranda E.; Timms, Peter] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Carver, Scott] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hanger, Jon] EndeavourVet Ecol, 1695 Pumicestone Rd, Toorbul, Qld 4510, Australia","Queensland Government (Department of Transport and Main Roads); Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council; Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection; Moreton Bay Regional Council; Friends of Koala, Lismore; Koala Action Inc; Endeavour Veterinary Ecology; Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital; Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary; Redland City Council; VIDO, Canada","This project was significantly supported by the Queensland Government (Department of Transport and Main Roads) and specifically the Moreton Bay Rail project team.

Increases in the accessibility and resolution of genomic analysis as well as other high-throughput technologies that can now measure the functional impact of genetic variation have continued to be one of the leading drivers of innovations that can address important anthropological questions. I would like to highlight the surprising discoveries this year within the framework of three interconnected themes: (1) increased inclusion of non-European peoples into mainstream genomics studies; (2) a more comprehensive integration of new technologies beyond genomics to better contextualize human biological variation; and (3) previously underappreciated ethical discussion points emerging from these novel developments. In this review, I will attempt to briefly outline a path for genetic anthropology, primarily using examples from recent work conducted with African populations. Consequently, I will not be able to do justice to breakthrough work in primate genomics, ancient genomics studies from around the world, and other fascinating studies in biological anthropology.

Incrementos en la accesibilidad y resolucion del analisis genomico, asi como otras tecnologias de alto rendimiento que pueden ahora medir el impacto funcional de la variacion genetica han continuado siendo uno de los principales conductores de innovaciones que pueden abordar cuestiones antropologicas importantes.

Given the considerable translation potential, two major strategies have emerged: supplementation of exogenous H2S and modulation of endogenous H2S metabolism. Recent Advances: Recently, it was reported that hepatic H2S production capacity is increased in two of the best-characterized mammalian models of life span extension, dietary restriction, and hypopituitary dwarfism, leading to new insights into dietary and hormonal regulation of endogenous H2S production together with broader changes in sulfur amino acid (SAA) metabolism with implications for DNA methylation and redox status. Critical Issues: Here, we discuss the role of dietary SAAs and growth hormone (GH)/thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in regulation of endogenous H2S production largely via repression of H2S generating enzymes cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) on the level of gene transcription, as well as reciprocal regulation of GH and TH signaling by H2S itself. We also discuss plasticity of CGL and CBS gene expression in response to environmental stimuli and the potential of the microbiome to impact overall H2S levels. Future Directions: The relative contribution of increased H2S to health span or lifespan benefits in models of extended longevity remains to be determined, as does the mechanism by which such benefits occur. Nonetheless, our ability to control H2S levels using exogenous H2S donors or by modifying the endogenous H2S production/consumption equilibrium has the potential to improve health and increase ""shelf-life'' across evolutionary boundaries, including our own.","[Hine, Christopher] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Zhu, Yan; Hollenberg, Anthony N.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhu, Yan; Hollenberg, Anthony N.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Mitchell, James R.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Genet & Complex Dis, 655 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA", [AG050777];  [DK090629];  [AG036712];  [DK098525];  [DK056123],This work was supported by the following grants: nos.

We provide two examples in which the same core biochemical processes that sustain life are distributed across a consortium of individuals of different species. Although the same chemistry features in both examples, proponents of the holobiont as unit of evolution would recognize one of the two cases as a multispecies individual whilst they would consider the other as a compelling case of ecological dependence between separate individuals. Some widely used arguments in support of the 'holobiont' concept apply equally to both cases, suggesting that those arguments have misidentified what is at stake when seeking to identify a new level of biological individuality. One important aspect of biological individuality is evolutionary individuality. In line with other work on the evolution of individuality, we show that our cases can be distinguished by focusing on the fitness alignment between the partners of the consortia. We conclude that much of the evidence currently presented for the ubiquity and importance of multi-species individuals is simply not to the point, at least unless the issue of biological individuality is firmly divorced from the question of evolutionary individuality.","[Bourrat, Pierrick] Macquarie Univ, Dept Philosophy, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Bourrat, Pierrick] Univ Sydney, Sch Hist & Philosophy Sci, Main Quadrangle A14, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Bourrat, Pierrick; Griffiths, Paul E.] Univ Sydney, Dept Philosophy, Main Quadrangle A14, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Bourrat, Pierrick; Griffiths, Paul E.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Main Quadrangle A14, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0878650],"We are thankful to Maxime Ardre, Brett Calcott, Guilhem Doulcier, Andrew Holmes, Arnaud Pocheville, Steven Quistad, Paul Rainey, Karola Stotz and Elena Walsh for their comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

We describe important recent clinical advances and discuss their broader societal impact. These advances include more expansive strategies for disease prevention, the rise of precision medicine, applications of human microbiome research, and new and highly successful treatments for hepatitis C infection. Theserecent developments in clinical research raise important issues surrounding health carecosts and equitable resource allocation that necessitate an ongoing dialogue among the fields of clinical medicine, population health, and healthpolicy. ContextDevelopments in clinical medicine have important implications for population health, and there is a need for interdisciplinary engagement among clinical medicine, the social sciences, and public health research. The aim of this article is to help bridge the divide between these fields by exploring major recent advances in clinical medicine that have important implications for population health. MethodsWe reviewed the most cited articles published from 2010 to 2015 in 5 high-impact clinical journals and selected 5 randomized controlled trials and 2 related clinical practice guidelines that are broadly relevant to population health and policy. FindingsWe discuss the following themes: (1) expanding indications for drug therapy and the inherent medicalization of the population as highlighted by studies and clinical guidelines supporting lower blood pressure targets or widespread statin use; (2) the tension in nutritional research between quantifying the impact of isolated nutrients and studying specific foods and dietary patterns, for example, the role of the Mediterranean diet in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease; (3) the issue of high medication costs and the challenge of providing equitable access raised by the development of new and effective treatments for hepatitis C infection; (4) emerging clinical applications of research on the human microbiome as illustrated by fecal transplant to treat Clostridium difficile infections; and (5) the promise and limitations of precision medicine as demonstrated by the rise of novel targeted therapies in oncology.

Investment in conventional agriculture has supported its present yield advantage. However, organic agriculture with agroecological management has nascent capacity for sustainable production and for increasing yields in the future. Conventional systems have leveraged reductionist approaches to address pests, primarily through pesticides that seek to eliminate biological factors that reduce yield, but come at a cost to human and ecosystem health, and leave production systems vulnerable to the development of pest resistance to these chemicals or traits. Alternatives are needed, and are found in organic production approaches. Although both organic and agroecology approaches encompass more than pest management, this aspect is a pivotal element of our agricultural future.

The purpose of this paper is to appraise the literature on a select set of faecal biomarkers from a clinician's perspective. This practical review aims to examine key physiological processes that influence both gastrointestinal, as well as brain health, and to discuss how tools such as the characterisation of commensal bacteria, the identification of potential opportunistic, pathogenic and parasitic organisms and the quantification of gut microbiome biomarkers and metabolites can help inform clinical decisions of nutrition and lifestyle medicine practitioners.","[Toribio-Mateas, Miguel] Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, London NW4 4BT, England",Santander Universities scholarship,"Miguel Toribio-Mateas is a nutrition practitioner and doctoral researcher in clinical neuroscience and nutritional medicine at Middlesex University.

Neuronal damage is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia and multiple sclerosis, although such damage is also observed following neurotropic viral infections, stroke, genetic white matter diseases and paraneoplastic disorders. Despite the different aetiologies, for example, infections, genetic mutations, trauma and protein aggregations, neuronal damage is frequently associated with chronic activation of an innate immune response in the CNS. The growing awareness that the immune system is inextricably involved in shaping the brain during development as well as mediating damage, but also regeneration and repair, has stimulated therapeutic approaches to modulate the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the current understanding of how astrocytes and microglia, as well as neurons and oligodendrocytes, shape the neuroimmune response during development, and how aberrant responses that arise due to genetic or environmental triggers may predispose the CNS to neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the known interactions between the peripheral immune system and the brain, and review the current concepts on how immune cells enter and leave the CNS. A better understanding of neuroimmune interactions during development and disease will be key to further manipulating these responses and the development of effective therapies to improve quality of life, and reduce the impact of neuroinflammatory and degenerative diseases.","[Stephenson, Jodie; Amor, Sandra] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Neurosci & Trauma, Blizard Inst, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Stephenson, Jodie; Nutma, Erik; van der Valk, Paul; Amor, Sandra] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Pathol, Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society; Stichting MS Research,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Stichting MS Research for their work referenced in this review.

ASD is, however, often associated with medical co-morbidities and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is among the most common. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between GI dysfunction and the degree of social impairment in ASD. The etiology of GI abnormalities in ASD is unclear, though the association between GI dysfunction and ASD-associated behaviors suggest that overlapping developmental defects in the brain and the intestine and/or a defect in communication between the enteric and central nervous systems (ENS and CNS, respectively), known as the gut-brain axis, could be responsible for the observed phenotypes. Brain-gut abnormalities have been increasingly implicated in several disease processes, including ASD. As a critical modulator of ENS and CNS development and function, serotonin may be a nexus for the gut-brain axis in ASD. This paper reviews the role of serotonin in ASD from the perspective of the ENS. A murine model that has been demonstrated to possess brain, behavioral and GI abnormalities mimicking those seen in ASD harbors the most common serotonin transporter (SERT) based mutation (SERT Ala56) found in children with ASD. Discussion of the gut-brain manifestations in the SERT A1a56 mice, and their correction with developmental administration of a 5-HT4 agonist, are also addressed in conjunction with other future directions for diagnosis and treatment.","[Israelyan, Narek] Columbia Univ, Vagelos Coll Phys & Surg, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Margolis, Kara Gross] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Morgan Stanley Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [KO8DK093786]; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [PR160365]; Center for Discovery [NIAT35AG044303],"The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the following sources: NIH KO8DK093786 (KGM), The Department of Defense PR160365 (KGM), The Center for Discovery (KGM) and NIAT35AG044303 (NI).",10,JUN,2018,132,,10.1016/j.phrs.2018.03.020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Mediation analysis of the human microbiome in these complex relationships could potentially provide insights into the role of the microbiome in the etiology of disease and, more importantly, lead to novel clinical interventions by modulating the microbiome. However, due to the high dimensionality, sparsity, non-normality and phylogenetic structure of microbiome data, none of the existing methods are suitable for testing such clinically important mediation effect. Results: We propose a distance-based approach for testing the mediation effect of the human microbiome. In the framework, the nonlinear relationship between the human microbiome and independent/dependent variables is captured implicitly through the use of sample-wise ecological distances, and the phylogenetic tree information is conveniently incorporated by using phylogeny-based distance metrics. Multiple distance metrics are utilized to maximize the power to detect various types of mediation effect. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has correct Type I error control, and is robust and powerful under various mediation models. Application to a real gut microbiome dataset revealed that the association between the dietary fiber intake and body mass index was mediated by the gut microbiome.","[Zhang, Jie] Adobe Syst Inc, San Jose, CA 95110 USA; [Wei, Zhi] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Chen, Jun] Mayo Clin, Div Biomed Stat & Informat, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Chen, Jun] Mayo Clin, Ctr Individualized Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA",Mayo Clinic Gerstner Family Career Award; Mayo Clinic Center of Individualized Medicine,The work was supported by Mayo Clinic Gerstner Family Career Award and Mayo Clinic Center of Individualized Medicine.,2,Jun-01,2018,34,11,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty014,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability"

This study investigated the impact of 8-weeks prebiotics/probiotics supplementation on microbiome changes and responses to acute alcohol consumption. Methods 38 participants (21 females, 23.6 +/- 3.4 kg m(-2), mean +/- SD) attended the laboratory on two occasions separated by an 8-week intervention period. On each of these visits, a dose of alcohol (0.40 +/- 0.04 g kg(-1), Vodka + Soda-Water) was consumed over 10 min. Breath alcohol concentration was sampled over 5 h and alcohol pharmacokinetics was analysed using WinNonlin non-compartmental modelling (C-max, t(max), AUC(last)). For the intervention, participants were randomised to receive Placebo + Placebo (PLA), Placebo + Prebiotics (PRE), Probiotics + Placebo (PRO), or Probiotics + Prebiotics (SYN) in a double-blinded manner. Probiotics were a commercially available source of Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCFM (R)) and Bifidobacterium lactis (Bi-07). Prebiotics were a commercially available source of Larch Gum (from Larix occidentalis). Placebo was microcrystalline cellulose. Each visit, participants provided a stool sample, which was analysed to determine the presence of L. acidophilus and B. lactis. Differences between trials were analysed using paired samples t tests. Results Increased counts for at least one bacterial strain (L. acidophilus or B. lactis) were observed for all participants on SYN (n = 10) and PRO (n = 10) trials. No difference in Cmax or tmax was observed between trials when analysed by treatment condition or microbiome outcome. A significant decrease in AUC(last) was observed between trials for PLA (p = 0.039) and PRE (p = 0.030) treatments, and when increases in at least one bacterial strain (p = 0.003) and no microbiome changes (p = 0.016) were observed. Conclusion Consumption of probiotics appears to alter faecal counts of supplemental bacterial strains in otherwise healthy individuals.

The method is illustrated using ecological data on the abundances of species in sites and where the species are characterized by traits and sites by environmental variables. The trait data and environment data form the external constraints and the question is which traits and environmental variables are associated, how these associations drive species abundances and how they can be displayed in biplots.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action. Methods: Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist-ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale-SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre-to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite. Results: Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved - 7.1 points (95% CI - 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved - 9.7 points (95% CI - 18.7 to - 0.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism. Conclusions: Urinary metabolomics analysis is a useful tool to identify pathways that may be involved in the mechanism of action of treatments targeting abnormal physiology in ASD.","[Bent, Stephen; Lawton, Brittany; Warren, Tracy; Widjaja, Felicia; Delucchi, Kevin; Hendren, Robert L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, 401 Parnassus,LP-119, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bent, Stephen; Dang, Katherine; Delucchi, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, 401 Parnassus,LP-119, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Fahey, Jed W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Int Hlth & Cullman Chemoprotect Ctr, Dept Med, 855 N Wolfe St,Ste 625, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Fahey, Jed W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Int Hlth & Cullman Chemoprotect Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Mol Sci, 855 N Wolfe St,Ste 625, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Cornblatt, Brian] Nutramax Labs Consumer Care Inc, 2208 Lakeside Blvd, Edgewood, MD 21040 USA; [Kinchen, Jason M.] Metabolon Inc, 617 Davis Dr,Suite 400, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Bent, Stephen] UCSF, SFVAMC, Dept Med, 111-A1,4150 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA",JS Foundation,"This work was supported through funding from the JS Foundation.

Contributions cut across scales of organization, from the within-host dynamics of immune function, to population-level impacts on parasite transmission, to landscape-and regional-scale patterns of infection. In this concluding paper, we identify common threads and key findings from author contributions, including the consequences of resource subsidies for (i) host immunity; (ii) animal aggregation and contact rates; (iii) host movement and landscape-level infection patterns; and (iv) interspecific contacts and cross-species transmission. Exciting avenues for future work include studies that integrate mechanistic modelling and empirical approaches to better explore cross-scale processes, and experimental manipulations of food resources to quantify host and pathogen responses.

Microbiome science is illuminating the ways in which stress, socioeconomic disadvantage and social polices interact with lifestyle and behaviour to influence the micro and macro-level biodiversity that otherwise mediates health. Although the unfolding microbiome and mental health research is dominated by optimism in biomedical solutions (e.g. piobiotics, prebiotics), we focus on the upstream psychosocial and ecological factors implicated in dysbiosis; we connect grand scale biodiversity in the external environment with differences in human-associated microbiota, and, by extension, differences in immune function and mental outlook We argue that the success of planetary health as a new concept will be strengthened by a more sophisticated understanding of the ways in which individuals develop emotional connections to nature (nature relatedness) and the social policies and practices which facilitate or inhibit the pro-environmental values that otherwise support personal, public and planetary health.","[Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Princess Margaret Hosp, Sch Med, POB D184, Perth, WA 6001, Australia; [Wegienka, Ganesa] Henry Ford Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Logan, Alan C.] WUN, Res Grp, In VIVO, 6010 Pk Ave,Suite 4081, West New York, NJ 07093 USA; [Katz, David L.] Yale Univ, Griffin Hosp, Prevent Res Ctr, 130 Div St, Derby, CT 06418 USA","Danone Nutricia, Schiphol, Netherlands; Nestle Nutrition Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland; Bayer Dietary Supplements Division, Whippany, NJ, USA; Health World Inc., Queensland, Australia; Genuine Health, Toronto, Canada","SLP reports the following: Scientific Advisory Board and speakers fees from Danone Nutricia, Schiphol, Netherlands and Nestle Nutrition Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland; consultancy fees from Bayer Dietary Supplements Division, Whippany, NJ, USA; speakers fees from Health World Inc., Queensland, Australia; royalties from a trade paperback which discusses the microbiome.

Altered microbiome profiles, pro-inflammatory responses and impaired intestinal permeability have been observed in children with ASD and co-morbid GI symptoms, yet few studies have compared these findings to ASD children without GI issues or similarly aged typical developing children. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are biological signatures in terms of immune dysfunction and microbiota composition in children with ASD with GI symptoms. Methods: Children were enrolled in one of four groups: ASD and GI symptoms of irregular bowel habits (ASD(GI)), children with ASD but without current or previous GI symptoms (ASD(NoGI)), typically developing children with GI symptoms (TIDGI) and typically developing children without current or previous GI symptoms (TDNoGI). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood, stimulated and assessed for cytokine production, while stool samples were analyzed for microbial composition. Results: Following Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulation, the ASD(GI) group produced increased levels of mucosa-relevant cytokines including IL-5, IL-15 and IL-17 compared to ASD(NoGI). The production of the regulatory cytokine TGF beta 1 was decreased in the ASDGI group compared with both the ASD(NoGI) and TDNoGI groups. Analysis of the microbiome at the family level revealed differences in microbiome composition between ASD and TD children with GI symptoms; furthermore, a predictive metagenome functional content analysis revealed that pathways were differentially represented between ASD and TD subjects, independently of the presence of GI symptoms. The ASD(GI) also showed an over-representation of the gene encoding zonulin, a molecule regulating gut permeability, compared to the other groups. Conclusions: Overall our findings suggest that children with ASD who experience GI symptoms have an imbalance in their immune response, possibly influenced by or influencing metagenomic changes, and may have a propensity to impaired gut barrier function which may contribute to their symptoms and clinical outcome.

Immunization with aluminum adjuvants, as with helminth infection, induces a Th2 type cell mediated immune response, including eosinophilia, but does not induce an environment conducive to the induction of regulatory mechanisms. Helminths play a role in what is known as the hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that decreased exposure to microbes during a critical time in early life has resulted in the increased prevalence and morbidity of asthma and atopic disorders over the past few decades, especially in Western countries. In addition, gut and lung microbiome composition and their interaction with the immune system plays an important role in a properly regulated immune system. Disturbances in microbiome composition are a risk factor for asthma and allergies. We propose that immunization with aluminum adjuvants in general is not favorable for induction of regulatory mechanisms and, in the context of the hygiene hypothesis and microbiome theory, can be viewed as an amplifying factor and significant contributing risk factor for allergic diseases, especially in a genetically susceptible subpopulation.","[Terhune, Todd D.; Deth, Richard C.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Coll Pharm, 1382 Terry Bldg,3200 South Univ Dr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33328 USA",,,0,MAY,2018,15,5,10.3390/ijerph15050901,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Vaginal hygiene products in North America are part of a two billion dollar industry, which focuses on cleanliness and freshness in their advertising toward women. In interviewing women who were currently using or had previously used vaginal hygiene products, we found that vaginal cleanliness and freshness were also frequently brought up as reasons for using these products. Using an inductive thematic analysis informed by Braun and Clarke (2013) we explore how attaining a clean-and-fresh vagina has become a subjective physical need for the participants in our study. In a society where female genitalia are constructed as unclean, we argue the marketing of vaginal hygiene products contributes to the problematization of women's genitalia by suggesting women need to use these products to attain an ideal (i.e., clean and fresh) vagina. The reliance on vaginal hygiene products reported by participants in attaining sensations of vaginal cleanliness and freshness raises concerns in the context of medical literature suggesting adverse health risks that may result from using some of these products. Potential risks include bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and a higher susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, among others. We believe that companies that advertise these products as beneficial for vaginal health and hygiene can be perceived as not just misinforming women but also profiting from products that are harmful.","[Jenkins, Amanda L.; Crann, Sara E.; O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Money, Deborah M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Genome British Columbia,The present study was funded by the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and Genome British Columbia.,0,MAY,2018,78,09-Oct,10.1007/s11199-017-0824-1,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Social; Women's Studies"

It is composed of organisms that are less diverse than those of the outdoors and strongly sourced by, or dependent upon, human bodies. Yet, no one has ever compared the composition of species found in contemporary human homes to that of other structures built by mammals, including those of non-human primates. Here we consider the microbes and arthropods found in chimpanzee beds, relative to the surrounding environment (n = 41 and 15 beds, respectively). Based on the study of human homes, we hypothesized that the microbes found in chimpanzee beds would be less diverse than those on nearby branches and leaves and that their beds would be primarily composed of body-associated organisms. However, we found that differences between wet and dry seasons and elevation above sea level explained nearly all of the observed variation in microbial diversity and community structure. While we can identify the presence of a chimpanzee based on the assemblage of bacteria, the dominant signal is that of environmental microbes. We found just four ectoparasitic arthropod specimens, none of which appears to be specialized on chimpanzees or their structures. These results suggest that the life to which chimpanzees are exposed while in their beds is predominately the same as that of the surrounding environment.","[Thoemmes, Megan S.; Dunn, Robert R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Thoemmes, Megan S.; Dunn, Robert R.] North Carolina State Univ, Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Bertone, Matthew A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Baltzegar, David A.; Borski, Russell J.; Coyle, Kaitlin P.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Baltzegar, David A.] North Carolina State Univ, Off Res Innovat & Econ Dev, Genom Sci Lab, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Stewart, Fiona A.; Hernandez-Aguilar, R.

Data Sources: PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and the Cummulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature were thoroughly searched for articles published between January 2000 and January 2017, using the keywords gut microbiome, gut microbiota, enteral microbiome, enteral microbiota, premature infant, preterm infant, extremely low birth weight infant, ELBW infant, very low birth weight infant, feeding, breast milk, breastfeeding, formula, prebiotic, probiotic, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid. Study Selection: Primary studies written in English and focused on the association between enteral feeding and gut microbiome patterns of preterm infants were included in the review. Data Extraction: We independently reviewed the selected articles and extracted information using predefined data extraction criteria including study design, study participants, type of feeding, type and frequency of biospecimen (e.g., feces, gastric aspirate) collection, microbiological analysis method, and major results. Data Synthesis: In 4 of the 18 studies included in the review, researchers described the effects of milk products (mothers' own milk, donor human milk, and formula). In 5 studies, the effects of prebiotics were assessed, and in 9 studies, the effects of probiotics on the gut microbiome were described. Mothers' own breast milk feeding influenced the compositional structure of preterm infants' gut microbial community and increased diversity of gut microbiota compared with donor human milk and formula feeding. The results of the use of prebiotics and probiotics varied among studies; however, the majority of the researchers reported positive bifidogenic effects on the development of beneficial bacteria. Conclusion: Mothers' own milk is considered the best form of nutrition for preterm infants and the gut microbial community. Variation in fatty acid composition across infant feeding types can affect microbial composition. The evidence for supplementation of prebiotics and probiotics to promote the gut microbial community structure is compelling; however, additional research is needed in this area.","[Xu, Wanli; Judge, Michelle P.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, 231 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Maas, Kendra] Univ Connecticut, Microbial Anal Resources & Serv, Storrs, CT USA; [Hussain, Naveed] Univ Connecticut, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Hussain, Naveed] Connecticut Childrens Med Ctr, Neonatal Res, Hartford, CT USA; [McGrath, Jacqueline M.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, Ctr Nursing Scholarship, Storrs, CT USA; [McGrath, Jacqueline M.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, PhD Program, Storrs, CT USA; [McGrath, Jacqueline M.] Connecticut Childrens Med Ctr, Nursing Res, Hartford, CT USA; [Henderson, Wendy A.] NINR, Digest Disorders Unit, Biobehav Branch, Div Intramural Res,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cong, Xiaomei] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, Ctr Adv Managing Pain, Storrs, CT USA; [Cong, Xiaomei] Univ Connecticut, Inst Syst Genom, Farmington, CT USA; [Cong, Xiaomei] Univ Connecticut, Sch Med, Farmington, CT USA","National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR) [1K23NR014674, 1ZIANR000018]; Affinity Research Collaboratives award through the University of Connecticut Institute for Systems Genomics",Supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR) under award numbers 1K23NR014674 (X.

The connection between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and behavioral stress response is investigated here using a mixed-sex mouse cohort. Methods CF-1 mice underwent alternating days of restraint and forced swim for 19 days (male n = 8, female n = 8) with matching numbers of control animals at which point the 16S rRNA genes of gut microbiota were sequenced. Mixed linear models accounting for stress status and sex with individuals nested in cage to control for cage effects evaluated these data. Murine behaviors in elevated plus-maze, open-field, and light/dark box were investigated. Results Community-level associations with sex, stress, and their interaction were significant. Males had higher microbial diversity than females (p = .025). Of the 638 operational taxonomic units detected in at least 25% of samples, 94 operational taxonomic units were significant: 31 (stress), 61 (sex), and 34 (sex-stress interaction). Twenty of the 39 behavioral measures were significant for stress, 3 for sex, and 6 for sex-stress. However, no significant associations between behavioral measures and specific microbes were detected. Conclusions These data suggest sex influences stress response and the microbiota-gut-brain axis and that studies of behavior and the microbiome therefore benefit from consideration of how sex differences drive behavior and microbial community structure. Host stress resilience and absence of associations between stress-induced behaviors with specific microbes suggests that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation represents a threshold for microbial influence on host behavior. Future studies are needed in examining the intersection of sex, stress response, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","[Tsilimigras, Matthew C.

Accumulated studies indicate a crucial role for the gut microbiota in social development, but these mechanisms remain unclear. This review focuses on two strategies adopted to elucidate the complicated relationship between gut bacteria and host social behavior. In a top-down approach, researchers have attempted to correlate behavioral abnormalities with altered gut microbial profiles in rodent models of ASD, including BTBR mice, maternal immune activation (MIA), maternal valproic acid (VPA) and maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) offspring. In a bottom-up approach, researchers use germ-free (GF) animals, antibiotics, probiotics or pathogens to manipulate the intestinal environment and ascertain effects on social behavior. The combination of both approaches will hopefully pinpoint specific bacterial communities that control host social behavior. Further discussion of how brain development and circuitry is impacted by depletion of gut microbiota is also included. The converging evidence strongly suggests that gut microbes affect host social behavior through the alteration of brain neural circuits. Investigation of intestinal microbiota and host social behavior will unveil any bidirectional communication between the gut and brain and provide alternative therapeutic targets for ASD.

The reasons for gender differences in ASD are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated, but no definitive evidence exists to explain male predominance. In this review, evidence is presented to support a hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and metabolome play a role in gender dimorphism in children with autism. Metabolic products may affect not only gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system, but also behavior, supporting communication between GI tract and central nervous system. Furthermore, mood and anxiety may affect intestinal function, indicating bidirectional flow in the gut-brain axis. Several hormone-based hypotheses are discussed to explain the prevalence of autism in males. Observations in animal models and studies in humans on the intestinal microbiome and metabolome are reviewed to support the proposed gender dimorphism hypothesis. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiome is a contributing factor to the prevalence of ASD in boys either directly, through microbial metabolites and/or epigenetic factors capable of regulating host gene expression through DNA methylation and/or histone modification.","[Kushak, Rafail I.; Winter, Harland S.] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [Winter, Harland S.] Div Pediat Gastroenterol, 175 Cambridge St,CRPZ 5-560, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Autism Research Institute; James Brooks Foundation,"The authors thank Dr. Ashok SenGupta for his valuable comments.

These conditions disproportionately affect Mexican American women, yet few studies have examined the oral microbiota in this at-risk group. We characterized the 16S rDNA oral microbiome in 369 non-smoking women enrolled in the MD Anderson Mano a Mano Mexican American Cohort Study. Lower bacterial diversity, a potential indicator of oral health, was associated with increased age and length of US residency among recent immigrants. Grouping women by overarching bacterial community type (e.g., ""Streptococcus,"" ""Fusobacterium,"" and ""Prevotella"" clusters), we observed differences across a number of acculturation-related variables, including nativity, age at immigration, time in the US, country of longest residence, and a multi-dimensional acculturation scale. Participants in the cluster typified by higher abundance of Streptococcus spp. exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity and appeared the most acculturated as compared to women in the ""Prevotella"" group. Computationally-predicted functional analysis suggested the Streptococcus-dominated bacterial community had greater potential for carbohydrate metabolism while biosynthesis of essential amino acids and nitrogen metabolism prevailed among the Prevotella-high group. Findings suggest immigration and adaption to life in the US, a well-established mediator of disease risk, is associated with differences in oral microbial profiles in Mexican American women. These results warrant further investigation into the joint and modifying effects of acculturation and oral bacteria on the health of Mexican American women and other immigrant populations. The oral microbiome presents an easily accessible biomarker of disease risk, spanning biological, behavioral, and environmental factors.","[Hoffman, Kristi L.; Fowler, Jerry; Zhao, Hua; Scheet, Paul; Chow, Wong-Ho; Daniel, Carrie R.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Div Canc Prevent & Populat Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hutchinson, Diane S.; Smith, Daniel P.; Ajami, Nadim J.; Petrosino, Joseph F.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Alkek Ctr Metagen & Microbiome Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA","National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [CA016672, R25CA057730]","This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health [CA016672 to Ronald Depinho, MD; R25CA057730 to Shine Chang, PhD].

But what natural selection actually is (a force or a statistical outcome, for example) and the levels of the biological hierarchy (genes, organisms, species, or even ecosystems) at which it operates directly are still actively disputed among philosophers and theoretical biologists. Most formulations of evolution by natural selection emphasize the differential reproduction of entities at one or the other of these levels. Some also recognize differential persistence, but in either case the focus is on lineages of material things: even species can be thought of as spatiotemporally restricted, if dispersed, physical beings. Few consider-as ""units of selection"" in their own right-the processes implemented by genes, cells, species, or communities. ""It's the song not the singer"" (ITSNTS) theory does that, also claiming that evolution by natural selection of processes is more easily understood and explained as differential persistence than as differential reproduction. ITSNTS was formulated as a response to the observation that the collective functions of microbial communities (the songs) are more stably conserved and ecologically relevant than are the taxa that implement them (the singers). It aims to serve as a useful corrective to claims that ""holobionts"" (microbes and their animal or plant hosts) are aggregate ""units of selection,"" claims that often conflate meanings of that latter term. But ITSNS also seems broadly applicable, for example, to the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles and the definition of ecosystem function.","[Doolittle, W. Ford; Inkpen, S.

For HPV testing, self-sampling instead of clinician-sampling has proven to be equally accurate, in particular for assays that use nucleic acid amplification techniques. In addition, HPV testing of self-collected samples in combination with a follow-up Pap smear in case of a positive result is more effective in detecting precancerous lesions than a Pap smear alone. Self-sampling for HPV testing has already been adopted by some countries, while others have started trials to evaluate its incorporation into national cervical cancer screening programs. Self-sampling may result in more individuals willing to participate in cervical cancer screening, because it removes many of the barriers that prevent women, especially those in low socioeconomic and minority populations, from participating in regular screening programs. Several studies have shown that the majority of women who have been underscreened but who tested HPV-positive in a self-obtained sample will visit a clinic for follow-up diagnosis and management.

The proboscis monkey, Nasalis larvatus, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in N. larvatus, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of Trichuris spp., strongylids, and Strongyloides spp. but not Ascaris spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for Strongyloides spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of Strongyloides spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.","[Klaus, Annette; Roeper, Kathrin Monika; Radespiel, Ute; Zimmermann, Elke] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Zool, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany; [Klaus, Annette; Strube, Christina] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Parasitol, Ctr Infect Med, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany; [Schaarschmidt, Frank] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Biostat, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany; [Nathan, Senthilvel; Goossens, Benoit] Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Organisms & Environm Div, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Goossens, Benoit] Sabah Wildlife Dept, Danau Girang Field Ctr, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Klaus, Annette] Springer Heidelberg, Vet Med & Parasitol Dept, Heidelberg, Baden Wuerttemb, Germany; [Roeper, Kathrin Monika] Zoo Hannover, Zool Dept, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [D/12/40192, 332 4 04 106]","This work received support from German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (D/12/40192, grant number 332 4 04 106, Annette Klaus).

In this work, Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a biological model to assess the toxic effects of BPA, PPB, and TCS. The wild type strain, Bristol N2, was used in bioassays with the endpoints of lethality, growth, and reproduction; green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic strains with the hsp-3, hsp-4, hsp-16.2, hsp-70, sod-1, sod-4, cyp-35A4, cyp-29A2, and skn-1 genes were evaluated for their mRNA expression through fluorescence measurement; and quick Oil Red 0 (q ORO) was utilized to stain lipid deposits. Lethality was concentration-dependent, while TCS and PPB showed more toxicity than BPA. BPA augmented worm length, while PPB reduced it. All toxicants moderately increased the width and the width length ratio. BPA and PPB promoted reproduction, in contrast to TCS, which diminished it. All toxicants affected the mRNA expression of genes related to cellular stress, control of reactive oxygen species, and nuclear receptor activation. Lipid accumulation occurred in exposed worms. In conclusion, BPA, PPB, and TCS alter the physiology of growth, lipid accumulation, and reproduction in C. elegans, most likely through oxidative stress mechanisms.","[Cecilia Garcia-Espineira, Maria; Olivero-Verbel, Jesus] Univ Cartagena, Environm & Computat Chem Grp, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Zaragocilla Campus, Cartagena 130015, Colombia; [Patricia Tejeda-Benitez, Lesly] Univ Cartagena, Biol Toxicol & Environm Sci Res Grp, Sch Med, Zaragocilla Campus, Cartagena 130015, Colombia",University of Cartagena,The authors are grateful to David De Pomerai in the University of Nottingham (UK) for supplying the transgenic strains of C. elegans; to Joel Meyer in Duke University (USA) for providing the N2 strain; to the University of Cartagena for the financial support through the Doctorate Support Program 2013-2017; and to Valeria De Leon-Garcia for the language edition.,4,APR,2018,15,4,10.3390/ijerph15040684,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In particular, anthropogenic activity, such as the use of nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers, is associated with environmental destruction and this calls for a more ecofriendly strategy to increase nitrogen levels in agricultural land. This feat is attainable by harnessing nitrogen-fixing endophytic and free-living rhizobacteria. Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Azospirillum and Bacillus, have been found to have positive impacts on crops by enhancing both above and belowground biomass and could therefore play positive roles in achieving sustainable agriculture outcomes. Thus, it is necessary to study this rhizosphere microbiome with more sophisticated culture-independent techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS) with the prospect of discovering novel bacteria with plant growth promoting traits.

In addition to being serious mental illnesses, these disorders are associated with considerable systemic physiological dysfunction, including chronic inflammation and elevated oxidative stress. The advent of sophisticated sequencing techniques has led to a growing interest in the potential role of gut microbiota in human health and disease. Advances in this area have transformed our understanding of a number of medical conditions and have generated a new perspective suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in the development and maintenance of brain/mental health. Animal models have demonstrated strong though indirect evidence for a contributory role of intestinal microbiota in psychiatric symptomatology and have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions. We present a systematic review of clinical studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The published literature has a number of limitations; however, the investigations suggest that these disorders are associated with reduced microbial diversity and show global community differences compared to non-psychiatric comparison samples. In some reports, specific microbial taxa were associated with clinical disease characteristics, including physical health, depressive and psychotic symptoms, and sleep, but little information on the functional potential of those community changes. Studies also suggest increased intestinal inflammation and permeability, which may be among the principal mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis impacts systemic physiological functioning.

Specifically, perinatal SSRI exposure may have long-term consequences for body weight and related health outcomes in the newborn period and beyond. This review focuses on the impact of perinatal SSRI exposure on weight using human and animal findings. The impact of maternal mood is also explored. We propose potential mechanisms for weight changes, including how early alterations in serotonin signaling may have implications for weight via changes in metabolism and motor development. As the majority of serotonin is in the gastrointestinal (GI) system we also speculate that perinatal SSRI exposure might alter the brain-gut relationship, via the microbiome, leading to changes in feeding behavior and weight.

This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the May 2016 annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, describes concepts of causation, outlines the trajectory of research on nongenetic factors beginning in the 1960s, and briefly reviews the current state of this science. Causal concepts are introduced, including root causes; pitfalls in interpreting time trends as clues to etiologic factors; susceptible time windows for exposure; and implications of a multi-factorial model of ASD. An historical background presents early research into the origins of ASD. The epidemiologic literature from the last fifteen years is briefly but critically reviewed for potential roles of, for example, air pollution, pesticides, plastics, prenatal vitamins, lifestyle and family factors, and maternal obstetric and metabolic conditions during her pregnancy. Three examples from the case-control CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes and the Environment Study are probed to illustrate methodological approaches to central challenges in observational studies: capturing environmental exposure; causal inference when a randomized controlled clinical trial is either unethical or infeasible; and the integration of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences on development. We conclude with reflections on future directions, including exposomics, new technologies, the microbiome, gene-by-environment interaction in the era of -omics, and epigenetics as the interface of those two. As the environment is malleable, this research advances the goal of a productive and fulfilling life for all children, teen-agers and adults. Autism Res2018, 11: 554-586. (c) 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay SummaryThis Keynote Lecture, delivered at the 2016 meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, discusses evidence from human epidemiologic studies of prenatal factors contributing to autism, such as pesticides, maternal nutrition and her health. There is no single cause for autism. Examples highlight the features of a high-quality epidemiology study, and what comprises a compelling case for causation. Emergent research directions hold promise for identifying potential interventions to reduce disabilities, enhance giftedness, and improve lives of those with ASD.","[Hertz-Picciotto, Irva; Schmidt, Rebecca J.; Krakowiak, Paula] Univ Calif Davis, MIND Inst Med Invest Neurodev Disorders, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UG3-OD023365, UL1-TR000002]; National Institute of Environmental Health SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P01-ES011269, P30-ES023513, R01-ES015359, R01-ES020392, R01-ES028089, R01-ES025574, R21-ES021330, T32-MH073124]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [U54-HD079125]; U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R829388, R833292, RD-83543201]; U.S. Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [AR110194]; Allen Foundation",Grant sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Grant numbers: UG3-OD023365; UL1-TR000002; Grant sponsor: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Grant numbers: P01-ES011269; P30-ES023513; R01-ES015359; R01-ES020392; R01-ES028089; R01-ES025574; R21-ES021330; T32-MH073124; Grant sponsor: Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Grant number: U54-HD079125; Grant sponsor: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Grant numbers: R829388; R833292; RD-83543201; Grant sponsor: U.S. Department of Defense; Grant number: AR110194; Grant sponsor: The Allen Foundation.,15,APR,2018,11,4,10.1002/aur.1938,"Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Developmental"

IBS patients report that pain is the most distressing symptom with the greatest impact on quality of life. Pain-sensitivity genes and the gut microbiome may influence severity of symptoms as well as response to self-management (SM) interventions. Based on current understanding of the science of SM, pain neurophysiology, and the gut-brain axis, our team developed a pain SM intervention to be added to evidence-based self-management instruction to increase the individual's SM knowledge and skills (self-efficacy, self-regulation, and goal-setting). The purpose of this randomized controlled longitudinal pilot study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the IBS-painSMintervention on IBS-pain SM behaviors and related health outcomes. A sample of 80 young adults (age 18-29 years old) will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Both groups will receive 10 electronic video modules focused on IBS-pain SM knowledge and skills. The experimental group also will receive nurse-led one-on-one phone consultations to facilitate monitoring and problem-solving. All participants will be followed over 12 weeks. Primary outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, including IBS-pain SM behaviors, quality of life, and well-being. The influence of pain-sensitivity genes and the gut microbiome on IBS-pain SM behaviors and health outcomes also will be assessed.","[Cong, Xiaomei; Ramesh, Divya; Perry, Mallory; Xu, Wanli; Bernier, Katherine M.; Young, Erin E.; Walsh, Stephen; Starkweather, Angela] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, 231 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Cong, Xiaomei; Starkweather, Angela] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Adv Managing Pain, Storrs, CT USA; [Cong, Xiaomei] Univ Connecticut, Inst Syst Genom, Farmington, CT USA; [Starkweather, Angela] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Accelerating Precis Pain Self Management P20, Storrs, CT USA",National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR) [NIH-NINR P20NR016605],"National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR), Grant number: NIH-NINR P20NR016605",2,APR,2018,41,2,10.1002/nur.21862,Nursing

This review focuses on the current understanding of how alcohol affects the brain in cirrhosis patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Chronic alcohol use is associated with nutritional deficiencies, dementia, cirrhosis, and decompensating events such as HE. Direct toxicity on brain tissue, induction of neuro-inflammation, and alcohol's alterations of the gut microbiome are possible mechanisms for the clinical features of HE associated with alcohol use. Acute management of the alcoholic cirrhosis patient with altered mental status should focus on ruling out other causes, best intensive care, and use of gut-based therapies such as lactulose and rifaximin. Long-term management centers on optimizing treatment of concurrent mood disorders, nutritional support, and medical management of complications associated with cirrhosis. Future studies are needed to clarify mechanisms of brain injury in concomitant alcohol misuse and HE in addition to designing treatment interventions in order to improve outcomes in these patients.","[Davis, Brian C.; Bajaj, Jasmohan S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, 1201 Broad Rock Blvd, Richmond, VA 23221 USA; [Davis, Brian C.; Bajaj, Jasmohan S.] McGuire VA Med Ctr, 1201 Broad Rock Blvd, Richmond, VA 23221 USA",VA Merit ReviewUS Department of Veteran Affairs [10CX001076],"The authors have no financial disclosures, and the manuscript was supported by VA Merit Review 10CX001076.

The composition of vaginal microbiota can be affected by various health behaviors, such as vaginal douching. The purpose of this study was to examine the types and prevalence of diverse vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors among participants living in Canada and to examine associations between behavioral practices and adverse gynecological health conditions. Method: An anonymous online survey, available in English and French, was distributed across Canada. The sample consisted of 1435 respondents, 18 years or older, living in Canada. Results: Respondents reported engaging in diverse vaginal/genital health and hygiene behavioral practices, including the use of commercially manufactured products and homemade and naturopathic products and practices. Over 95% of respondents reported using at least one product in or around the vaginal area. Common products and practices included vaginal/genital moisturizers, anti-itch creams, feminine wipes, washes, suppositories, sprays, powders, and waxing and shaving pubic hair. The majority of the sample (80%) reported experiencing one or more adverse vaginal/genital symptom in their lifetime. Participants who had used any vaginal/genital product(s) had approximately three times higher odds of reporting an adverse health condition. Several notable associations between specific vaginal/genital health and hygiene products and adverse health conditions were identified. Conclusions: This study is the first of its kind to identify the range and prevalence of vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors in Canada. Despite a lack of credible information about the impact of these behaviors on women's health, the use of commercially manufactured and homemade products for vaginal/genital health and hygiene is common.

The complexity of Hg in the environment can hinder accurate determination of ecological and human health risks, particularly within the context of the rapid global changes that are altering many ecological processes, socioeconomic patterns, and other factors like infectious disease incidence, which can affect Hg exposures and health outcomes. However, the success of global Hg-reduction efforts depends on accurate assessments of their effectiveness in reducing health risks. In this paper, we examine the role that key extrinsic and intrinsic drivers play on several aspects of Hg risk to humans and organisms in the environment. We do so within three key domains of ecological and human health risk. First, we examine how extrinsic global change drivers influence pathways of Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food webs. Next, we describe how extrinsic socioeconomic drivers at a global scale, and intrinsic individual-level drivers, influence human Hg exposure. Finally, we address how the adverse health effects of Hg in humans and wildlife are modulated by a range of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers within the context of rapid global change. Incorporating components of these three domains into research and monitoring will facilitate a more holistic understanding of how ecological and societal drivers interact to influence Hg health risks.","[Eagles-Smith, Collin A.] US Geol Survey, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Silbergeld, Ellen K.] Johns Hopkin Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,E6644, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Basu, Niladri] McGill Univ, 204 CINE Bldg, Montreal, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Bustamante, Paco] Univ La Rochelle, Lab Littoral Environm & Soc, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, LIENSs UMR 7266,CNRS, 2 Rue Olympe de Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Diaz-Barriga, Fernando] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Ctr Appl Res Environm & Hlth, Ave Venustiano Carranza 2405, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico; [Hopkins, William A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 310 West Campus Dr,Cheatham Hall,Room 106 MC 0321, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kidd, Karen A.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Kidd, Karen A.] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Nyland, Jennifer F.] Dept Biol Sci, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA","Dartmouth College Toxic Metals Superfund Research Program through National Institute of Environmental Health [R13 ES028077-01, P42ES007373]; USGS Environmental Health Mission Area, Contaminant Biology Program; IUF (Institut Universitaire de France)","The paper was written as part of the synthesis effort for the 13th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant, Providence, Rhode Island, July 16-21, 2017.

A substantial portion of the differences in cancer rates can be explained by modifiable factors, and many important relationships have been documented between diet, physical activity, and obesity, and incidence of important cancers. Other related factors, such as the microbiome and the metabolome, are emerging as important intermediary components in cancer prevention. It is possible with the incorporation of newer technologies and studies including long follow up and evaluation of effects across the life cycle, additional convincing results will be produced. However, several challenges exist for cancer researchers; for example, measurement of diet and physical activity, and lack of standardization of samples for microbiome collection, and validation of metabolomic studies.

In this paper, I contrast microbiology's current diversity ideal with its influential predecessor in the twentieth century, that of purity, as epitomized in Robert Koch's bacteriological culture methods. Purity and diversity, the two polar opposites with regard to making sense of the microbial world, have been operationalized in microbiological practice by tools such as the ""clean'' Petri dish versus the ""dirty'' Winogradsky column, the latter a container that mimics, in the laboratory, the natural environment that teems with diverse microbial life. By tracing the impact of the practices and concepts of purity and diversity on microbial classification through a history of techniques, tools, and manuals, I show the shifts in these concepts over the last century. Juxtaposing the dominant purity ideal with the more restricted, but continuously articulated, diversity ideal in microbial ecology not only provides a fresh perspective on microbial classification that goes beyond its intellectual history, but also contex-tualizes the present focus on diversity. By covering the period of a century, this paper outlines a revised longue duree historiography that takes its inspiration from artifacts, such as Petri dish and the Winogradsky column, and thereby simple, but influential technologies that often remain invisible. This enables the problem of historical continuity in modern science to be addressed and the accelerationist narratives of its development to be countered.","[Grote, Mathias] Humboldt Univ, Inst Geschichtswissensch, Friedrichstr 191-193, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",,,4,MAR,2018,40,1,10.1007/s40656-017-0175-9,History & Philosophy Of Science

This paper aims to provide an updated meta-analysis on the topic. Methods: Using the keywords [probiotics OR gut OR microflora OR microbiome OR bacteria OR yeast OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium] AND [mood OR depression OR MDD OR suicide], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Ovid, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR) and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine database yielded 917 papers published in English between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-June-2017. Results: 10 clinical trials with a total of 1349 patients were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. There was no significant difference in mood between the treatment and placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.128 (95% CI -0.261 to 0.00463, P=0.059). A separate subgroup analysis of studies conducted in healthy versus depressed individuals found significant improvements in the moods of individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (SMD -0.684, 95% CI -1.296 to -0.0712, P=0.029) and non-significant effects in healthy individuals (SMD -0.0999, 95% CI -0.235 to 0.0348, P=0.146). Limitations: Inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing, bacterial strains and strain combinations limit the comparability of current clinical trials. Furthermore, majority of existing RCTs were conducted in healthy individuals, making it difficult to extrapolate the results to depressed individuals. Conclusion: Probiotic supplementation has an overall insignificant effect on mood. Future studies should be conducted on more patients with clinically diagnosed depression.","[Ng, Qin Xiang] KK Womens & Childrens Hosp, 100 Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 229899, Singapore; [Peters, Christina] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Ho, Collin Yih Xian; Yeo, Wee-Song] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Natl Univ Hosp, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Lim, Donovan Yutong] Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, 10 Buangkok View, Singapore 539747, Singapore; [Yeo, Wee-Song] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore 117597, Singapore",,,52,Mar-01,2018,228,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.11.063,Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry

Data from several randomized clinic trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. The exact mechanism by which an increased adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet exerts its favorable effects is not known. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the five most important adaptations induced by the Mediterranean dietary pattern are: (a) lipid-lowering effect, (b) protection against oxidative stress, inflammation and platelet aggregation, (c) modification of hormones and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, (d) inhibition of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid restriction, and (e) gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites influencing metabolic health. More studies are needed to understand how single modifications of nutrients typical of the Mediterranean diet interact with energy intake, energy expenditure, and the microbiome in modulating the key mechanisms that promote cellular, tissue, and organ health during aging.","[Tosti, Valeria; Bertozzi, Beatrice; Fontana, Luigi] Washington Univ, Dept Med, Div Geriatr & Nutr Sci, St Louis, MO USA; [Fontana, Luigi] Univ Brescia, Med Sch, Dept Clin & Expt Sci, Brescia, Italy",National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [UL1 RR024992]; Longer Life Foundation (RGA/Washington University Partnership); Bakewell Foundation,"Dr. Fontana's research is supported by grants from the Bakewell Foundation, the Longer Life Foundation (an RGA/Washington University Partnership), and the National Center for Research Resources (UL1 RR024992).",44,MAR,2018,73,3,10.1093/gerona/glx227,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology

This study examines the response of gut microbial community structure and function to changes in diet in wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus), a primate that incorporates a large proportion of invertebrates in its diet. The goal of the study is to better understand the role of both fruit and invertebrate prey consumption on shaping primate gut microbiomes. Materials and methodsFecal samples (n=169) and dietary data were collected over 12 months. The V3-V5 region of microbial 16S rRNA genes was amplified and sequenced. The IM-TORNADO pipeline was used to analyze sequences. ResultsWhite-faced capuchin gut bacterial communities were characterized primarily by Firmicutes (41.6%) and Proteobacteria (39.2%). There was a significant relationship between the invertebrate diet composition of individual capuchins and their gut microbiome composition. However, there was no relationship between the fruit diet composition of individual capuchins and their gut microbiome composition, even when examining multiple timescales. DiscussionThe results of our study indicate that there is a stronger relationship between gut microbial community structure and invertebrate diet composition than between gut microbial community structure and fruit consumption. As invertebrates and other animal prey play an important role in the diet of many primates, these results give important insight into the role of faunivory in shaping the evolution of host-microbe interactions in primates.","[Mallott, Elizabeth K.; Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, 1810 Hinman Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Garber, Paul A.; Malhi, Ripan S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 109A Davenport Hall,607 South Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Malhi, Ripan S.] Univ Illinois, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, 1206 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",UIUC Department of Anthropology; Beckman Institute at UIUC; Center for Latin American Studies at UIUC; NSF GRFP programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,UIUC Department of Anthropology; Beckman Institute at UIUC; Center for Latin American Studies at UIUC; NSF GRFP program; Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,10,MAR,2018,165,3,10.1002/ajpa.23395,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology

When the condition causes pathological symptoms and/or complications it is considered gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). It appears to be increasingly diagnosed and causes great distress in the first year of infancy. In New South Wales (NSW), residential parenting services support families with early parenting difficulties. These services report a large number of babies admitted with a label of GOR/GORD. The aim of this study was to explore the maternal and infant characteristics, obstetric interventions, and reasons for clinical reporting of GOR/GORD in NSW in the first 12 months following birth (2000-2011). Methods: A three phase, mixed method sequential design was used. Phase 1 included a linked data population based study (n = 869,188 admitted babies). Phase 2 included a random audit of 326 medical records from admissions to residential parenting centres in NSW (2013). Phase 3 included eight focus groups undertaken with 45 nurses and doctors working in residential parenting centres in NSW. Results: There were a total of 1,156,020 admissions recorded of babies in the first year following birth, with 11,513 containing a diagnostic code for GOR/GORD (1% of infants admitted to hospitals in the first 12 months following birth). Babies with GOR/GORD were also more likely to be admitted with other disorders such as feeding difficulties, sleep problems, and excessive crying. The mothers of babies admitted with a diagnostic code of GOR/GORD were more likely to be primiparous, Australian born, give birth in a private hospital and have: a psychiatric condition; a preterm or early term infant (37-or-38 weeks); a caesarean section; an admission of the baby to SCN/NICU; and a male infant. Thirty six percent of infants admitted to residential parenting centres in NSW had been given a diagnosis of GOR/GORD. Focus group data revealed two themes: ""It is over diagnosed"" and ""A medical label is a quick fix, but what else could be going on?"" Conclusions: Mothers with a mental health disorder are nearly five times as likely to have a baby admitted with GOR/GORD in the first year after birth. We propose a new way of approaching the GOR/GORD issue that considers the impact of early birth (immaturity), disturbance of the microbiome (caesarean section) and mental health (maternal anxiety in particular).","[Dahlen, Hannah Grace; Foster, Jann P.; Psaila, Kim; Schmied, Virginia; Thornton, Charlene] Western Univ Sydney, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Dahlen, Hannah Grace; Foster, Jann P.] Ingham Inst, Liverpool, NSW, Australia; [Foster, Jann P.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Obstet Gynaecol & Neonatol, Ctrl Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Spence, Kaye; Badawi, Nadia] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Grace Ctr Newborn Care, Cnr Hawkesbury Rd & Hainsworth St, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Badawi, Nadia] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fowler, Cathrine] Univ Technol, Tresillian Chair Child & Family Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Funding was provided by an Australian Research Council Partnership grant between Western Sydney University, Tresillian and Karitane.",1,Feb-12,2018,18,,10.1186/s12887-018-0999-9,Pediatrics

There is an urgent need to develop a new treatment for depression. Although still at its early stage, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promising potential for treating depression. In this article, we first summarize the results of clinical studies on the treatment effect of taVNS on depression. Then, we re-analyze a previous study to identify the specific symptoms taVNS can relieve as indicated by subscores of the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale in patients with depression. We found that taVNS can significantly reduce multiple symptoms of depression patients, including anxiety, psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbance, and hopelessness. Next, we pose several hypotheses on the mechanism of taVNS treatment of depression, including directly and indirectly modulating the activity and connectivity of key brain regions involved in depression and mood regulation; inhibiting neuro-inflammatory sensitization; modulating hippocampal neurogenesis; and regulating the microbiome-brain-gut axis. Finally, we outline current challenges and lay out the future directions of taVNS treatment of depression, which include (1) intensively comparing stimulation parameters and ""dose effect"" (treatment frequency and duration) to maximize the treatment effect of taVNS; (2) exploring the effect of taVNS on disorders comorbid with depression (such as chronic pain disorders, cardiovascular disorder, and autism) to provide new ""two-for-one"" treatment approaches for patients with these disorders; and (3) applying multiple scale methods to explore the underlying mechanism of taVNS.","[Kong, Jian; Park, Joel] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fang, Jiliang] Chiha Acad Chinese Med Sci, Guanganmen Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaoyuan; Rong, Peijing] Chiha Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Acupuncture & Moxibust, Beijing, Peoples R China","NIH/NCCIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01AT006364, R01 AT008563, R21 AT008707, R61AT009310, P01AT006663]; Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z161100002616003]; International project [GH2017-07]; National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81774433, 81273674]; Innovation Talent Fund [CX201708];  [TR01 AT006367];  [K24AT007323]","JK is supported by TR01 AT006367 and K24AT007323 to Dr. Chenchen Wang.

Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO & NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto) immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine, leaky gut and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO & NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO & NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO & NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general. This review provides a new IO & NS model of prenatal and postpartum depression.","[Roomruangwong, Chutima; Maes, Michael] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Anderson, George] CRC, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Anderson, George] CRC, London, England; [Berk, Michael; Maes, Michael] Deakin Univ, Impact Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Orygen, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Stoyanov, Drozdstoy; Maes, Michael] Med Univ Plovdiv, Dept Psychiat & Med Psychol, Technol Ctr Emergency Med, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Carvalho, Andre F.] Univ Fed Ceara, Fac Med, Translat Psychiat Res Grp, Dept Clin Med, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Chulalongkorn UniversityChulalongkorn University; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1059660],This research is funded by Chulalongkorn University; Government Budget.

BT positively modulates mitochondrial function, including enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and beta-oxidation and has been proposed as a neuroprotectant. BT and other SCFAs have also been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We have developed a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) model of ASD, with a subset of LCLs demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction (AD-A) and another subset of LCLs demonstrating normal mitochondrial function (AD-N). Given the positive modulation of BT on mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that BT would have a preferential positive effect on AD-A LCLs. To this end, we measured mitochondrial function in ASD and age-matched control (CNT) LCLs, all derived from boys, following 24 and 48 h exposure to BT (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM) both with and without an in vitro increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also examined the expression of key genes involved in cellular and mitochondrial response to stress. In CNT LCLs, respiratory parameters linked to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were attenuated by 1 mM BT. In contrast, BT significantly increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production in AD-A LCLs but not in AD-N LCLs. In the context of ROS exposure, BT increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production for all groups. BT was found to modulate individual LCL mitochondrial respiration to a common set-point, with this set-point slightly higher for the AD-A LCLs as compared to the other groups. The highest concentration of BT (1 mM) increased the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fission (PINK1, DRP1, FIS1) and physiological stress (UCP2, mTOR, HIF1a, PGC1a) as well as genes thought to be linked to cognition and behavior (CREB1, CamKinase II). These data show that the enteric microbiome-derived SCFA BT modulates mitochondrial activity, with this modulation dependent on concentration, microenvironment redox state, and the underlying mitochondrial function of the cell. In general, these data suggest that BT can enhance mitochondrial function in the context of physiological stress and/ or mitochondrial dysfunction, and may be an important metabolite that can help rescue energy metabolism during disease states. Thus, insight into this metabolic modulator may have wide applications for both health and disease since BT has been implicated in a wide variety of conditions including ASD. However, future clinical studies in humans are needed to help define the practical implications of these physiological findings.","[Rose, Shannon; Bennuri, Sirish C.; Davis, Jakeira E.; Wynne, Rebecca; Slattery, John C.; Tippett, Marie; Delhey, Leanna; Melnyk, Stephan; Kahler, Stephen G.; Frye, Richard E.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Rose, Shannon; Bennuri, Sirish C.; Davis, Jakeira E.; Wynne, Rebecca; Slattery, John C.; Tippett, Marie; Delhey, Leanna; Melnyk, Stephan; Kahler, Stephen G.; Frye, Richard E.] Arkansas Childrens Res Inst, Little Rock, AR USA; [MacFabe, Derrick F.] Alberta Childrens Prov Gen Hosp, Res Inst, Kilee Patchell Evans Autism Res Grp, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Frye, Richard E.] Phoenix Childrens Hosp, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurodev Disorders, Phoenix, AZ USA","Arkansas Biosciences Institute (Little Rock, AR); GoodLife Children's Charities; Autism Research Institute; Autism Canada","We thank the autism families that participated in the Autism Genetic Research Exchange and the studies at the National Institutes of Mental Health.

Accumulating data suggest that altered communication between gut microbiota and host systems could participate in disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune disorders as well as neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, anxiety, and major depressive disorders. The conceptual development of the microbiome-gut-brain axis has facilitated understanding of the complex and bidirectional networks between gastrointestinal microbiota and their host, highlighting potential mechanisms through which this environment influences central nervous system physiology. Communication pathways between gut microbiota and the central nervous system could include autonomic, neuroendocrine, enteric, and immune systems, with pathology resulting in disruption to neurotransmitter balance, increases in chronic inflammation, or exacerbated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. However, uncertainty remains regarding the generalizability of controlled animal studies to the more multifaceted pattern of human pathophysiology, especially with regard to the therapeutic potential for neuropsychiatric health. This narrative review summarizes current understanding of gut microbial influence over physiological function, with an emphasis on neurobehavioral and neurological impairment based on growing understanding of the gut-brain axis. Experimental and clinical data regarding means of therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota as a novel treatment option for mental health are described, and important knowledge gaps are identified and discussed.","[Bruce-Keller, Annadora J.; Salbaum, J.

Children with neurodevelopmental disorder, including ASD, are regularly affected by gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. On the other hand, humans live in a co-evolutionary association with plenty of microorganisms that resident on the exposed and internal surfaces of our bodies. The microbiome, refers to the collection of microbes and their genetic material, confers a variety of physiologic benefits to the host in many key aspects of life as well as being responsible for some diseases. A large body of preclinical literature indicates that gut microbiome plays an important role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that communicates between the gut and central nervous system. Moreover, accumulating evidences suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. The present review introduces the increasing evidence suggesting the reciprocal interaction network among microbiome, gut and brain. It also discusses the possible mechanisms by which gut microbiome influences the etiology of ASD via altering gut-brain axis.

This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders, focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade.","[Malan-Muller, Stefanie; Seedat, Soraya; Hemmings, Sian M.

Gut microbes and their metabolites may be linked not only to GI problems but also to ASD behavior symptoms. Despite this high interest, most previous studies have looked mainly at microbial structure, and studies on fecal metabolites are rare in the context of ASD. Thus, we aimed to detect fecal metabolites that may be present at significantly different concentrations between 21 children with ASD and 23 neurotypical children and to investigate its possible link to human gut microbiome. Using H-1-NMR spectroscopy and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we examined metabolite profiles and microbial compositions in fecal samples, respectively. Of the 59 metabolites detected, isopropanol concentrations were significantly higher in feces of children with ASD after multiple testing corrections. We also observed similar trends of fecal metabolites to previous studies: children with ASD have higher fecal p-cresol and possibly lower GABA concentrations. In addition, Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) with leave-out-validation suggested that a group of metabolites-caprate, nicotinate, glutamine, thymine, and aspartate-may potentially function as a modest biomarker to separate ASD participants from the neurotypical group (78% sensitivity and 81% specificity). Consistent with our previous Arizona cohort study, we also confirmed lower gut microbial diversity and reduced relative abundances of phylotypes most closely related to Prevotella copri in children with ASD. After multiple testing corrections, we also learned that relative abundances of Feacalibacterium prausnitzii and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were lower in feces of children with ASD. Despite a relatively short list of fecal metabolites, the data in this study support that children with ASD have altered metabolite profiles in feces when compared with neurotypical children and warrant further investigation of metabolites in larger cohorts.

Summary Compromised bone health often accompanies anorexia nervosa due to energy deficiency and hypoestrogenism. The gut microbiome has been implicated as a link between these conditions and impaired bone growth phenotypes. Current research supports decrements in Firmicutes and short-chain fatty acids with increases in Methanobrevibacter smithii and Proteobacteria in anorexia nervosa. A potential mechanism for microbiome-regulated bone growth is through modulation of insulin-like growth factor-1.

Moreover, there is increased emphasis on developing personalized or precision medicine targeted to individuals or groups of patients who share a certain biomarker signature. Learning healthcare systems (LHS) have been proposed for integration of research and clinical practice to fill major knowledge gaps, improve care, reduce healthcare costs, and provide precision care. To date, much discussion in this context has focused on the potential of human genomic data, and not yet on human microbiome data. Rapid advances in human microbiome research suggest that profiling of, and interventions on, the human microbiome can provide substantial opportunity for improved diagnosis, therapeutics, risk management, and risk stratification. In this study, we discuss a potential role for microbiome science in LHSs. We first review the key elements of LHSs, and discuss possibilities of Big Data and patient engagement. We then consider potentials and challenges of integrating human microbiome research into clinical practice as part of an LHS. With rapid growth in human microbiome research, patient-specific microbial data will begin to contribute in important ways to precision medicine. Hence, we discuss how patient-specific microbial data can help guide therapeutic decisions and identify novel effective approaches for precision care of inflammatory bowel disease.

Delayed IgA production is associated with greater risk of allergic disease. Murine models of stressful events during pregnancy and infancy show alterations in gut immunity and microbial composition in offspring, but little is known about the stress-microbiome-immunity pathways in humans. We investigated differences in infant fecal sIgA concentrations according to the presence of maternal depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy. A subsample of 403 term infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) cohort were studied. Their mothers completed the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale when enrolled prenatally and again postpartum. Quantified by Immundiagnostik sIgA ELISA kit, sIgA from infant stool was compared across maternal depressive symptom categories using Mann-Whitney U-tests and logistic regression models that controlled for various covariates. Twelve percent of women reported clinically significant depressive symptoms only prenatally, 8.7% had only postpartum symptoms and 9.2% had symptoms both pre and postnatally. Infants born to mothers with pre and postnatal symptoms had significantly lower median sIgA concentrations than those in the reference group (4.4 mg/g feces vs. 6.3 mg/g feces; p = 0.033). The odds for sIgA concentrations in the lowest quartile was threefold higher (95% CI: 1.25-7.55) when mothers had pre and postnatal symptoms, after controlling for breastfeeding status, infant age, antibiotics exposure and other covariates.

In the United States, it is currently estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from IBD, causing considerable suffering, mortality and economic loss every year. Yet the cause of IBD is unknown, and until we understand more, prevention or cure will not be possible. There is a lot of variation in the incidence and prevalence of CD based on geographic region, environment, immigrant population, and ethnic groups. The annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1-20.2 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population. Based on the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, CD is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder with multi factorial etiology in which genetics and environment interact to manifest the disease. Several genes have been studied so for with respect to CD, but thus far the strong and replicated associations have been identified with NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. The risk factors implicated with CD include smoking, low fiber-high carbohydrate diet,altered microbiome and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CD is typically characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine and could affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. In terms of distribution of the disease 25% of the patients have colitis only, 25% is ileitis only and 50% have ileocolitis. The Montreal classification is based on the age at diagnosis (< 16, 17-40, > 40), disease location (Real, colonic, Ileocolonic) and the disease behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, stricturing, penetrating). The key features for diagnosing CD comprises a combination of radiographic, endoscopic and pathological findings demonstrating focal, asymmetric, transmural or granulomatous features. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) enterography is the most preferred first-line radiologic study used in the assessment of small bowel CD. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis is similar to that of CT scans and also prevents exposure to ionizing radiation. Endoscopic scores are considered to be the gold standard tool to measure the activity of CD and they are used more commonly in the clinical trials to measure the efficacy of various drugs on inducing and maintaining mucosa] healing. The most common scoring systems used to measure clinical disease activity include Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), HBI- Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and Lehmann score. Management of Crohn's disease has been seen as an evolving challenge owing to its widely heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping characteristics with other inflammatory disorders, often elusive extraintestinal manifestations and uncertain etiology. Therapeutic interventions are tailored to address symptomatic response and subsequent tolerance of the intervention. Chronology of treatment should favor treatment dose acute disease or ""induction therapy"", followed by maintenance of adequate response or remission, i.e. ""maintenance therapy"". The medications which are highly effective in inducing remission include steroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors. Medications used to maintain remission include 5-aminosalicyclic acid products, immunomodulators (Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab). Surgical interventions like bowel resection, stricturoplasty or drainage of abscess is required in up to two thirds of CD patients during their lifetime. The most common indications for surgical resection are medically refractory disease, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage, intractable hemorrhage, dysplasia or cancer. Endoscopic recurrence in postoperative CD patients, as defined by Rutgeers score i2-i4 occur in 30-90% of the patients at the neoterminal ileum within 12 months of surgery and almost universally by 5 years. Treating CD requires a comprehensive care team including the patient, primary care provider, and gastroenterologist. In summary CD is a chronic inflammatory condition with a remitting and relapsing course primarily affecting relatively younger population with significant socioeconomic effects.

Additionally, the use of pharmaceuticals may interact with and alter the microbiota to potentially contribute to adverse effects of the drug. The gut microbiota has been described in several psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety, but only a few reports have discussed the role of the microbiome in schizophrenia.

However, the role of the oral microbiota in ASD remains unexplored. Via high-throughput sequencing of 111 oral samples in 32 children with ASD and 27 healthy controls, we demonstrated that the salivary and dental microbiota of ASD patients were highly distinct from those of healthy individuals. Lower bacterial diversity was observed in ASD children compared to controls, especially in dental samples. Also, principal coordinate analysis revealed divergences between ASD patients and controls. Moreover, pathogens such as Haemophilus in saliva and Streptococcus in plaques showed significantly higher abundance in ASD patients, whereas commensals such as Prevotella, Selenomonas, Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium were reduced. Specifically, an overt depletion of Prevotellaceae co-occurrence network in ASD patients was obtained in dental plaques. The distinguishable bacteria were also correlated with clinical indices, reflecting disease severity and the oral health status (i.e. dental caries). Finally, diagnostic models based on key microbes were constructed, with 96.3% accuracy in saliva. Taken together, this study characterized the habitat-specific profile of the oral microbiota in ASD patients, which might help develop novel strategies for the diagnosis of ASD.","[Qiao, Yanan; Zhou, Zhichong; Chen, Lei; Chen, Fengshan] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Tooth Restorat & Regenerat, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Orthodont, Shanghai 200072, Peoples R China; [Wu, Mingtao] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Tooth Restorat & Regenerat, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Endodont, Shanghai 200072, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yanhuizhi] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Tooth Restorat & Regenerat, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Periodont, Shanghai 200072, Peoples R China","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81371129, 81670973]","This study was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81371129& 81670973).

This systematic review thus aimed to investigate the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation improves schizophrenia symptoms. Methods: By using the keywords (probiotic OR gut OR microbiota OR microbiome OR yogurt OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium) AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis), a preliminary search of the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials. gov, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR), and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine databases yielded 329 papers published in English between January 1, 1960 and May 1, 2018. Attempts were made to search grey literature as well. Results: Three clinical studies were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. Applying per-protocol analysis and a fixed-effects model, there was no significant difference in schizophrenia symptoms between the group that received probiotic supplementation and the placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference was -0.0884 (95% CI -0.380 to 0.204, p = 0.551). Separate analyses were performed to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia alone. In both instances, no significant difference was observed as well. Conclusion: Based on current evidence, limited inferences can be made regarding the efficacy of probiotics in schizophrenia. Although probiotics may have other benefits, for example to regulate bowel movement and ameliorate the metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications, the clinical utility of probiotics in the treatment of schizophrenia patients remains to be validated by future clinical studies.

This paper proposes that concepts of hygiene should be updated, given this reorientation of harm. However, little research has been conducted, which a) integrates knowledge from the diverse disciplinary fields concerned with indoor environments (such as microbiology, chemistry, and design), and b) examines how individuals conceptualize and enact hygiene to create healthier indoor environments for their families, including the extent to which their practices achieve this. To gain insight into factors influencing how hygiene is enacted in the home, as well as the consequent effects on the composition of indoor environments, it is necessary to transgress traditional disciplinary approaches to investigate indoor environmental health and integrate knowledge from experts and lay people who inhabit these spaces. To do this, recent scientific and design literature addressing key determinants of environmental health in homes are consulted. This is combined with qualitative research into the ways in which parents define, perform, and measure hygiene within domestic spaces. The data collected concerns homes in Sydney, Australia, with the findings showing that common hygiene practices with potentially harmful outcomes often emerge from compromises between competing priorities within complexes of home practices. Factors influencing the dynamics that determine which activities are prioritized and how they are performed are dually highlighted. Some notable factors include confusion and uncertainty associated with the sensory proxies used to determine cleanliness and risk of harm, increased sensitivity to the potential presence of microbes over other potentially harmful microspecies, and the health histories and experiences of parents and children.","[Wakefield-Rann, Rachael; Fam, Dena] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stewart, Susan] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,0,,2018,24,2,10.22459/HER.24.02.2018.04,Environmental Studies; Sociology

The concentration and composition of indoor air pollutants are determined by a multitude of variables, with building ventilation type being the most predominant factor in most scenarios. A predictive statistical model-based methodology for mapping airborne fungi was developed utilizing satellite-based technology. Mapping was carried out for total aerosolized fungal spores and the diversity of aerosolized fungi in Sydney, Australia, over four seasons. Corresponding data for a range of environmental parameters known to influence airborne fungi were also used, notably green space density, land cover, altitude, meteorological variables, and other locally determined factors. Statistical models previously developed from the combined meteorological and environmental variable data were used to establish spatiotemporal models for airborne fungi across the study area for each season. Results showed that the models produced reasonable predictions of monitored aeromycota concentrations; although, the accuracy of these predictions for individual survey periods was variable. Using known indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of airborne fungi for the area, the prevalence and concentrations of indoor aeromycota were modeled for buildings with both natural and mechanical ventilation. As accurate manual assessment of the aeromycota is labor, time, and cost intensive, the current findings should assist in the prediction of fungal aerosols in both urban and indoor environments. Additionally, understanding the indoor microbiome has great importance for the health and well-being of the occupants concerned.","[Douglas, Ashley; Torpy, Fraser] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Fac Sci, Plants & Environm Qual Res Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Surawski, Nic; Irga, Peter] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Australian Government Research Training Program Stipend - Australian Government; University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship scheme,"Ashley N.

BD pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and relapses are associated with numerous circadian rhythm abnormalities. In addition, infradian fluctuations of mood, social activity, weight and sleep patterns are very frequent in BD. Disease course with a seasonal pattern (SP) occurs in approximately 25% of depressive and 15% of manic episodes, which is coupled to a more severe disease symptomatology. The pathophysiological mechanisms of seasonal effects in BD await clarification, with likely important clinical consequences. This review aims at synthesizing available data regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of seasonality in BD patients, with implications for future research directions in the study of seasonality in BD. Three factors are suggested to play significant roles in BD with SP, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei, as well as the melatonergic and photoperiodism systems. It is proposed that BD with SP may be considered as a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of clock gene vulnerabilities and biological clock neuroplasticity, with environmental factors, such as the response to light. Light seems to play a key role in BD with SP, mainly due to two seasonal signaling pathways: a light to cortex serotonin transporter pathway, as well as a pathway connecting light to melatonin synthesis. This provides a theoretical framework for BD with SP, including for future research and clinical management. The review proposes that future research should explore markers of seasonality in BD, such as plasma melatonin, sleep-wake rhythms (with actigraphy) and genetic or epigenetic variants within the melatonin synthesis pathway. The role of light in driving BD with SP is an active area of research. Seasonality may also be intimately linked to wider aspects of BD, including via interactions with the gut microbiome, the gut-liver axis, cholesterol regulation, aspects of metabolic syndrome, vitamin D, decreased longevity, suicide risk and medication treatment targets. Further research on the role of seasonality in BD is likely to clarify the etiology, course and treatment of BD more widely.","[Maruani, Julia; Etain, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Geoffroy, Pierre A.] INSERM, U1144, Paris, France; [Maruani, Julia; Etain, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Geoffroy, Pierre A.] Univ Paris 05, UMR S 1144, Paris, France; [Maruani, Julia; Etain, Bruno; Lejoyeux, Michel; Bellivier, Frank; Geoffroy, Pierre A.] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR S 1144, Paris, France; [Maruani, Julia; Etain, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Geoffroy, Pierre A.] GH St Louis Lariboisiere F Widal, AP HP, Pole Psychiat & Med Addictol, Paris, France; [Maruani, Julia; Etain, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Geoffroy, Pierre A.] Fondat FondaMental, Creteil, France; [Anderson, George] CRC Scotland & London, London, England; [Lejoyeux, Michel] Paris Hosp Grp Psychiat & Neurosci, Dept Epidemiol, Paris, France; [Lejoyeux, Michel] Univ Hosp Bichat Claude Bernard, AP HP, Dept Psychiat & Addict Med, Paris, France; [Lejoyeux, Michel] Paris Diderot Univ Paris VII, Paris, France",INSERM (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale)Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); AP-HP (Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris); Fondation FondaMental (RTRS Sante Mentale); labex Bio-PSY (Investissements d'Avenir program)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02],"Authors acknowledge the support provided by INSERM (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale), AP-HP (Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris), the Fondation FondaMental (RTRS Sante Mentale), and the labex Bio-PSY (Investissements d'Avenir program managed by the ANR under reference ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02).",6,,2018,35,10,10.1080/07420528.2018.1487975,Biology; Physiology

Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota may be involved in frailty physiopathology by promoting chronic inflammation and anabolic resistance. The contribution of gut microbiota to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia is less defined, even though the concept of ""gut-brain axis"" has been well demonstrated for other neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current state-of-the-art literature on the gut microbiota alterations associated with cognitive frailty, mild cognitive impairment and dementia and elucidate the effects of pre- or probiotic administration on cognitive symptom modulation in animal models of aging and human beings. We identified 47 papers with original data (31 from animal studies and 16 from human studies) suitable for inclusion according to our aims. We concluded that several observational and intervention studies performed in animal models of dementia (mainly Alzheimer's disease) support the concept of a gut-brain regulation of cognitive symptoms. Modulation of vagal activity and bacterial synthesis of substances active on host neural metabolism, inflammation and amyloid deposition are the main mechanisms involved in this physiopathologic link. Conversely, there is a substantial lack of human data, both from observational and intervention studies, preventing to formulate any clinical recommendation on this topic. Gut microbiota modulation of cognitive function represents, however, a promising area of research for identifying novel preventive and treatment strategies against dementia.","[Ticinesi, Andrea; Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Parma, Italy; [Ticinesi, Andrea; Tana, Claudio; Nouvenne, Antonio; Prati, Beatrice; Lauretani, Fulvio; Meschi, Tiziana] Parma Univ Hosp, Geriatr Rehabil Dept, Via Antonio Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Ticinesi, Andrea; Nouvenne, Antonio; Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Microbiome Res Hub, Parma, Italy",,,16,,2018,13,,10.2147/CIA.S139163,Geriatrics & Gerontology

Method: This review provides that the summarization of the communication among microbiota, gut and brain and the results of preclinical and clinical studies on gut microbiota used in treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.

The gut, being the major portal of communication with the external environment, has recently been brought to the forefront of this interaction with the establishment of a gut-brain axis in health and disease. Moreover, recent breakthroughs in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice have demonstrated the significant impact of the microbiome in modulating behavioral responses in mice and have established a more specific microbiome-gut-behavior axis. One of the mechanisms by which this axis affects social behavior is by regulating myelination at the prefrontal cortex, an important site for complex cognitive behavior planning and decision-making. The prefrontal cortex exhibits late myelination of its axonal projections that could extend into the third decade of life in humans, which make it susceptible to external influences, such as microbial metabolites. Changes in the gut microbiome were shown to alter the composition of the microbial metabolome affecting highly permeable bioactive compounds, such as p-cresol, which could impair oligodendrocyte differentiation. Dysregulated myelination in the prefrontal cortex is then able to affect behavioral responses in mice, shifting them towards social isolation. The reduced social interactions could then limit microbial exchange, which could otherwise pose a threat to the survival of the existing microbial community in the host and, thus, provide an evolutionary advantage to the specific microbial community. In this review, we will analyze the microbiome-gut-behavior axis, describe the interactions between the gut microbiome and oligodendrocytes and highlight their role in the modulation of social behavior.","[Ntranos, Achilles; Casaccia, Patrizia] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurol, Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Ctr Multiple Sclerosi, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Casaccia, Patrizia] CUNY, Neurosci Initiat, Adv Sci Res Ctr, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Casaccia, Patrizia] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA","NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R37NS42925]; NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01 NS042925, R37 NS042925]",,4,JAN,2018,15,1,10.1007/s13311-017-0597-9,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Moreover, increasing evidence supports the role of the microbiome and microbiota-derived molecules in regulating such interactions; however, the mechanisms underpinning such effects are only beginning to be resolved. Microbiota-gut peptide interactions are poised to be of great significance in the regulation of gut-brain signaling. Given the emerging role of the gut-brain axis in a variety of brain disorders, such as anxiety and depression, it is important to understand the contribution of bidirectional interactions between peptide hormones released from the gut and intestinal bacteria in the context of this axis. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the largest endocrine organ in mammals, secreting dozens of different signaling molecules, including peptides. Gut peptides in the systemic circulation can bind cognate receptors on immune cells and vagus nerve terminals thereby enabling indirect gut-brain communication. Gut peptide concentrations are not only modulated by enteric microbiota signals, but also vary according to the composition of the intestinal microbiota. In this review, we will discuss the gut microbiota as a regulator of anxiety and depression, and explore the role of gut-derived peptides as signaling molecules in microbiome-gut-brain communication. Here, we summarize the potential interactions of the microbiota with gut hormones and endocrine peptides, including neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor, oxytocin, and ghrelin in microbiome-to-brain signaling. Together, gut peptides are important regulators of microbiota-gut-brain signaling in health and stress-related psychiatric illnesses.","[Lach, Gilliard; Schellekens, Harriet; Dinan, Timothy G.; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Schellekens, Harriet] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland; [Schellekens, Harriet; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Food Hlth Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland",Science Foundation Ireland (APC Microbiome Institute) [SFI/12/RC/2273],"This work was supported by Science Foundation Ireland in the form of a center grant (APC Microbiome Institute; Grant No. SFI/12/RC/2273).

An extensive search of the literature has been conducted from different bibliographic databases with a total of n = 26 studies found. The majority of diseases found consisted of infectious diseases and internal medicine conditions such as schistosomiasis or emphysema. These are just 2 examples of many that, instead of primarily affecting bone, muscle or skin, specifically target internal organs. Hence, a better understanding of the evolution of diseases that still affect mankind could be gained.

Importantly, they have been found to affect human health. However, scientific research on human microbial communities has created new challenges for human subject recruitment. First, individuals are asked to collect samples of bodily substances that can be seen as repulsive (e.g. feces and urine). Second, because scientists want to understand how human microbial communities evolve over time, individuals are asked to commit to a regular sample collection for extended periods of time. A longitudinal qualitative study of the work of scientists, physicians, research staff, and study coordinators involved in a human microbiome research project has found that these actors can bypass some aspects of these recruitment and retention challenges through 'tuning work'. Tuning work is a collaborative process where professionals agree to adjust their practices towards shared goals. Such professionals reconfigure their work practices, personal routines, and the study protocol in an effort to obviate cultural taboos against handling bodily substances. The burden of long-term participation provides fewer opportunities for tuning work for these professionals, however. As such, long-term commitment by human subjects remains a recruitment and retention obstacle.","[Maekinen, Elina I.] Univ Tampere, New Social Res & Fac Management, Tampere 33014, Finland",,,0,,2018,27,4,10.1080/09505431.2018.1508429,Cultural Studies; History & Philosophy Of Science

Within this framework, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) serves as an important tool for gaining insight into human variability and responses and for developing risk-based assessments in the face of sparse or highly complex measurement data. The analytical procedures that provide data for clinical and public health efforts are continually evolving to expand our knowledge base of the many thousands of environmental and biomarker chemicals that define human systems biology. These chemicals range from the smallest molecules from energy metabolism (i.e., the metabolome), through larger molecules including enzymes, proteins, RNA, DNA, and adducts. In additiona, the human body contains exogenous environmental chemicals and contributions from the microbiome from gastrointestinal, pulmonary, urogenital, naso-pharyngeal, and skin sources. This complex mixture of biomarker chemicals from environmental, human, and microbiotic sources comprise the human exposome and generally accessed through sampling of blood, breath, and urine. One of the most difficult problems in biomarker assessment is assigning probative value to any given set of measurements as there are generally insufficient data to distinguish among sources of chemicals such as environmental, microbiotic, or human metabolism and also deciding which measurements are remarkable from those that are within normal human variability. The implementation of longitudinal (repeat) measurement strategies has provided new statistical approaches for interpreting such complexities, and use of descriptive statistics based upon intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) has become a powerful tool in these efforts. This review has two parts; the first focuses on the history of repeat measures of human biomarkers starting with occupational toxicology of the early 1950s through modern applications in interpretation of the human exposome and metabolic adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). The second part reviews different methods for calculating the ICC and explores the strategies and applications in light of different data structures.","[Pleil, Joachim D.; Wallace, M.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that mental illness and related disturbances do not necessarily originate in the brain. Inflammation has been suggested to play a central role in psychiatric disorders and altered levels of peripheral cytokines have been reported in several studies. Recently, it has emerged that bacteria populating the human gut could modulate low-grade inflammation, as well as high-order brain functions, including mood and behavior. These bacteria constitute the microbiota, a large population comprising 40,000 bacterial species and 1,800 phila involved in key processes important to maintain body homeostasis. Method: In this review, we present and discuss studies exploring the role of dysbiosis and products of the gut-microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, as well as their potential involvement in mediating the effect of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. Results: Although this field is still at its early stage of development, a growing number of studies suggest that an altered composition of the gut microbiota, together with translocation of bacterial products into the systemic circulation, might play a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders as well as in response to psychotropic medications.

Drawing on qualitative interviews with 10 clinicians in Canada, we explore their perspectives for insights into translation of human microbiome science. The emphasis on novelty in much microbiome scholarship, we suggest, does not account fully for the ways in which microbiome science translations may be taken up in multiple ways that are both disruptive to and continuous with contemporary biomedicine. We suggest that clinicians drew on scientific discourses of evidence and facts as a form of boundary work to re-establish a separation between western biomedicine and alternative health practitioners, and clinical expertise and lay knowledge. We conclude with a discussion of human microbiome science and the emergence of post-Pasteurian modes of health in western biomedicine.","[Haw, Jennie; O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON, Canada",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),This work was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.,0,,2018,37,1,10.1080/14636778.2018.1430561,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Issues; Social Sciences, Biomedical"

The only psychopharmacological treatment options for EDs with approval in some countries include fluoxetine for BN and lisdexamfetamine for BED. Given the high comorbidity and genetic correlations with other psychiatric disorders, it seems possible that novel medications for these conditions might also be effective in EDs. Areas covered: The current scientific literature has increased our understanding of how medication could be beneficial for patients with EDs on a molecular, functional and behavioral level. On the basis of theoretical considerations about neurotransmitters, hormones and neural circuits, possible drug targets for the treatment of EDs may include signal molecules and receptors of the self-regulatory system such as serotonin, norepinephrine and glutamate, the hedonic system including opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine and the hypothalamic homeostatic system including histamine, ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Expert commentary: The latest research points to an involvement of both the immune and the metabolic systems in the pathophysiology of EDs and highlights the importance of the microbiome. Therefore, the next few years may unveil drug targets for EDs not just inside and outside of the brain, but possibly even outside of the human body.","[Himmerich, Hubertus; Treasure, Janet] Kings Coll London, Dept Psychol Med, 103 Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England",,,18,,2018,11,1,10.1080/17512433.2018.1383895,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

We measured market integration as a proxy for economically related lifestyle attributes, such as ownership of specific market goods that index degree of market integration and components of traditional and nontraditional (more modern) house structure and infrastructure, and profiled the fecal microbiomes of 213 participants from a contiguous, indigenous Ecuadorian population. Despite relatively modest differences in lifestyle across the population, greater economic development correlated with significantly lower within-host diversity, higher between-host dissimilarity, and a decrease in the relative abundance of the bacterium Prevotella. These microbiome shifts were most strongly associated with more modern housing, followed by reduced ownership of traditional subsistence lifestyle-associated items. IMPORTANCE Previous research has reported differences in the gut microbiome between populations residing in wealthy versus poorer countries, leading to the assertion that lifestyle changes associated with economic development promote changes in the gut microbiome that promote the proliferation of microbiome-associated diseases. However, a direct relationship between economic development and the gut microbiome has not previously been shown. We surveyed the gut microbiomes of a single indigenous population undergoing economic development and found significant associations between features of the gut microbiome and lifestyle changes associated with economic development. These findings suggest that even the earliest stages of economic development can drive changes in the gut microbiome, which may provide a warning sign for the development of microbiome-associated diseases.","[Stagaman, Keaton; Bohannan, Brendan J.

Many of the epidemiologic findings on PD etiology have been challenged by alternative explanations such as reverse causation. This is mainly because PD often takes decades to develop before it can be diagnosed late in life. Convincing evidence shows that this prodromal stage of PD is characterized by various prodromal symptoms such as olfactory impairment and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). As they likely reflect PD pathogenesis years, if not decades, before nigrostriatal involvement, research on these symptoms may represent an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the etiology of PD. Using PD prodromal symptoms as intermediate phenotypes, we may be able to identify factors that contribute to the development of these symptoms and factors that modify their progression to clinical PD. Further, this line of research will also enable examinations of novel etiological hypotheses of PD development such as the microbiome and prion hypotheses. In this article, the author used olfactory impairment and RBD as examples to illustrate the promises and challenges of epidemiologic research on prodromal symptoms to understand PD etiology.","[Chen, Honglei] Michigan State Univ, Coll Human Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, 909 Fee Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University [GE100455],The author is supported by a start-up fund from the Michigan State University (GE100455).,5,,2018,8,1,10.3233/JPD-171238,Neurosciences

Nurses are advocates, educators, practitioners, scientists, and researchers, and are crucial to the design and successful implementation of -omics studies, particularly including minority communities. The contribution of nursing in this area of research is crucial to reducing health disparities. MethodsIn this article, challenges in the conduct of -omics-based research in minority communities are discussed, and recommendations for improving diversity among nurse scientists, study participants, and utilization of training and continuing education programs in -omics are provided. Findings and ConclusionsMany opportunities exist for nurses to increase their knowledge in -omics and to continue to build the ranks of nurse scientists as leaders in -omics-based research. In order to work successfully with communities of color, nurse scientists must advocate for participation in the Precision Medicine Initiative, improve representation of nurse faculty of color, and increase utilization of training programs in -omics and lead such initiatives.

For obvious ethical reasons, the same level of experimental control is not possible in human populations. Nonetheless, there are natural experimental designs in human populations that can serve as logical extensions of the rigorous quantitative genetic experimental designs used by animal and plant researchers. Applying concepts such as cross-fostering and common garden rearing approaches from the life science discipline, we describe human designs that can serve as naturalistic proxies for the controlled quantitative genetic experiments facilitated in life sciences research. We present the prevention relevance of three such human designs: (1) children adopted at birth by parents to whom they are not genetically related (common garden approach); (2) sibling designs where one sibling is reared from birth with unrelated adoptive parents and the other sibling is reared from birth by the biological mother of the sibling pair (cross-fostering approach); and (3) in vitro fertilization designs, including egg donation, sperm donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy (prenatal cross-fostering approach). Each of these designs allows for differentiation of the effects of the prenatal and/or postnatal rearing environment from effects of genes shared between parent and child in naturalistic ways that can inform prevention efforts. Example findings from each design type are provided and conclusions drawn about the relevance of naturalistic genetic designs to prevention science.","[Leve, Leslie D.] Univ Oregon, Prevent Sci Inst, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Neiderhiser, Jenae M.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Harold, Gordon T.] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Harold, Gordon T.] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Natsuaki, Misaki N.] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Bohannan, Brendan J.

The long-term goal of this integration is to clarify the contribution of social conditions in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota late in life. Research on the microbiome, which is considered to be of parallel importance to human health as the human genome, has been hindered by human studies with nonrandomly selected samples and with limited data on social conditions over the life course. Methods: No existing population-based longitudinal study had collected fecal specimens. Consequently, we created an in-person protocol to collect stool specimens from a subgroup of WLS participants. Results: We collected 429 stool specimens, yielding a 74% response rate and one of the largest human samples to date. Discussion: The addition of data on the gut microbiome to the WLS- and to other population based longitudinal studies of aging-is feasible, under the right conditions, and can generate innovative research on the relationship between social conditions and the gut microbiome.","[Herd, Pamela; Schaeffer, Nora Cate; DiLoreto, Kerryann; Jacques, Karen; Stevenson, John; Rey, Federico; Roan, Carol] Univ Wisconsin, Lafollette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA","National Institutes for Health, National Institute on Aging [P30 AG017266]","Support for this proposal was provided by the National Institutes for Health, National Institute on Aging (P30 AG017266).",5,JAN,2018,73,1,10.1093/geronb/gbx029,"Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology; Psychology; Psychology, Multidisciplinary"

Methods: We searched studies investigating the relationship between the feeding mode in infancy and the energy balance, so the possible associations with total energy expenditure and intake regulation. We focused the research on the interaction with the neuropsychological development and the possible role of microbiome in determinating the normal generation and regular functioning of the brain through the so named ""gut-brain axis"". Results: Total energy expenditure (TEE) is different for breast-fed and formula-fed infants, in particular the feeding mode seems to affect the sleep organisation. Long-term breastfeeding, is one of the most studied factors of neurodevelopment, several studies reporting beneficial effects on child neuropsychological development. Probably this effect is modulated by genetic variations in fatty acid metabolism. Increasing data also showed that the intestinal microbiome exerts several functions which are able to influence neurodevelopment. Limitations: There is considerable controversy over whether nutrition in early life has a long-term influence on neurodevelopment. Other studies are needed to confirm the association between breastfeeding and brain development. Conclusions: The key points of energy disposal, the role and effects of the instestinal flora represent promising fields of investigation possibly leading to indications for the wide area of preventive medicine.","[Agostoni, Carlo; Mazzocchi, Alessandra; Leone, Ludovica] Univ Milan, Dept Clin Sci & Community Hlth, Pediat Intermediate Care Unit, Fdn IRCCS,Osped Ca Granda,Osped Maggiore Policlin, Milan, Italy; [Leone, Ludovica] Univ Milan, Dept Biomed & Clin Sci Luigi Sacco, Milan, Italy; [Ciappolino, Valentina; Altamura, Carlo A.; Brambilla, Paolo] Univ Milan, Osped Maggiore Policlin, Fdn IRCCS Ca Granda, Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Delvecchio, Giuseppe] IRCCS, E Medea Sci Inst, Milan, Italy; [Brambilla, Paolo] Univ Texas Houston, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Houston, TX 77025 USA",,,1,Dec-15,2017,224,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.01.001,Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry

Although still unresolved, these problems are well studied in macro-ecology (the ecology of non-microbes) and are reiterated here as an historical precautionary for microbial ecologists. Beyond expected and unresolved terminological vagueness, we argue that assessments and comparisons of taxonomic and functional profiles in micro-ecology suffer from theoretically unresolvable arbitrariness and ambiguities.

However, the explanation of how periodontitis can lead to dementia remains unclear. A working hypothesis links extrinsic inflammation as a secondary cause of AD. This hypothesis suggests a compromised oral hygiene leads to a dysbiotic oral microbiome whereby Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone periodontal pathogen, with its companion species, orchestrates immune subversion in the host. Brushing and chewing on teeth supported by already injured soft tissues leads to bacteremias. As a result, a persistent systemic inflammatory response develops to periodontal pathogens. The pathogens, and the host's inflammatory response, subsequently lead to the initiation and progression of multiple metabolic and inflammatory co-morbidities, including AD. Insufficient levels of essential micronutrients can lead to microbial dysbiosis through the growth of periodontal pathogens such as demonstrated for P. gingivalis under low hemin bioavailability. An individual's diet also defines the consortium of microbial communities that take up residency in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiomes. Their imbalance can lead to behavioral changes. For example, probiotics enriched in Lactobacillus genus of bacteria, when ingested, exert some anti-inflammatory influence through common host/bacterial neurochemicals, both locally, and through sensory signaling back to the brain. Early life dietary behaviors may cause an imbalance in the host/microbial endocrinology through a dietary intake incompatible with a healthy GI tract microbiome later in life. This imbalance in host/microbial endocrinology may have a lasting impact on mental health. This observation opens up an opportunity to explore the mechanisms, which may underlie the previously detected relationship between diet, oral/GI microbial communities, to anxiety, cognition and sleep patterns.

We aimed to investigate the gut microbiota composition of a large female cohort including different BMI groups and activity levels along with body composition parameters. Method106 female participants were included in this cross-sectional study: AN patients (n=18), athletes (n=20), normal weight (n=26), overweight (n=22), and obese women (n=20). DNA was extracted from stool samples and subjected to 16S rRNA gene analysis. The software Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) was used to analyze data. Additionally, we performed anthropometric assessments, ultrasound measurements of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness, bioimpedance analysis, administered depression inventories, and ascertained laboratory parameters and dietary intakes. ResultsAlpha diversity was particularly lower in AN patients and obese participants compared to other groups, while athletes showed highest alpha diversity. Several categories significantly associated with community structure were identified: body fat parameters, serum lipids, CRP, depression scales and smoking. Comparative analysis revealed Coriobacteriaceae as the only enriched phylotype in AN compared to other entities (LDA score >3.5). DiscussionThis study provides further evidence of intestinal dysbiosis in AN and sheds light on characteristics of the gut microbiome in different BMI and physical activity groups. These insights point to new modulation possibilities of the gut microbiota which could improve the standard therapy of AN.","[Moerkl, Sabrina; Painold, Annamaria; Holl, Anna] Med Univ Graz, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapeut Med, Auenbruggerpl 31-1, Graz, Austria; [Lackner, Sonja; Oberascher, Andreas; Holasek, Sandra] Med Univ Graz, Inst Pathophysiol & Immunol, Graz, Austria; [Mueller, Wolfram] Med Univ Graz, Inst Biophys, Graz, Austria; [Gorkiewicz, Gregor; Kashofer, Karl] Med Univ Graz, Inst Pathol, Graz, Austria; [Holzer, Peter] Med Univ Graz, Inst Expt & Clin Pharmacol, Graz, Austria; [Meinitzer, Andreas; Mangge, Harald] Med Univ Graz, Clin Inst Med & Chem Lab Diagnost, Graz, Austria",,,21,DEC,2017,50,12,10.1002/eat.22801,"Psychology, Clinical; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry; Psychology"

The composition and dynamics of this human microbiome are increasingly implicated in discussions of health. Attention has focused on missing microbes and their links to a range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Pathological dysbiosis is understood to result from both the excessive presence and the absence of microbes. Microbial declines have been indexed to modern hygiene and healthcare practices and there is a growing interest in the therapeutic use of beneficial microbes. This reappraisal of the salutary potential of microbes challenges the negative associations prevalent in health geography and the field of global health. This paper develops relational and multispecies approaches to health geography to examine situations of microbial excess, absence and controlled reintroduction. The analysis focuses on human relations with hookworms. Hookworms are animal members of the microbiome. They co-evolved with humans, live in us and are understood to manage the human microbiome to enable immunological tolerance. Both the excessive presence and the absence of hookworms can be pathological. They are currently the subjects of concurrent, but spatially discrete, programmes to deworm and reworm a variegated world. Focusing on this seeming spatial paradox, the analysis examines three types of human-hookworm relation: the parasite, the ghost and the mutualist. The conclusion reflects on the implications of this analysis for the human and nonhuman subjects of global health and the microbiopolitics of prevalent forms of antibiotic and probiotic healthcare.","[Lorimer, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",,,14,DEC,2017,42,4,10.1111/tran.12189,Geography

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common disorder with complex etiologies and usually accompanied by psychological diseases. More information concerning the urinary microbiome and psychological factors in OAB is required. The aim of this study was to characterize the female urinary microbiome associated with OAB and investigate the relationships between urinary microbiome and psychological factors. Methods: Thirty women with OAB and 25 asymptomatic controls were recruited and asked to finish the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Urine specimens were collected by transurethral catheterization and processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were processed using QIIME. LEfSe revealed significant differences in bacterial genera between controls and OAB patients. The relationships between the diversity of the urinary microbiome and psychological scores were identified by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: We found that bacterial diversity (Simpson index) and richness (Chao1) were lower in OAB samples compared to controls (P both = 0.038). OAB and control bacterial communities were significantly different (based on weighted UniFrac distance metric, R = 0.064, P = 0.037). LEfSe demonstrated that 7 genera were increased (e.g., Proteus and Aerococcus) and 13 were reduced (e.g., Lactobacillus and Prevotella) in OAB group compared to controls. There were negative correlations between scores on Self-Rating Depression Scale and both richness (Chao1, r = -0.458, P = 0.011) and diversity (Shannon index, r = -0.516, P = 0.003) of urinary microbiome in OAB group. Some bacterial genera of OAB women with anxiety or depression were significantly different from those without. Conclusions: The aberrant urinary microbiome with decreased diversity and richness may have strong implications in pathogenesis and treatment of OAB. Psychological conditions were correlated with characteristics of urinary microbiome in women with OAB. Further research is needed to understand the connection between central nervous system and urinary microbiome.","[Wu, Peng; Chen, Yang; Zhang, Guihao; Chen, Jiawei; Wang, Junpeng; Zhang, Huijian] Southern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Urol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jie] Southern Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Science and the Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province [2014A020212195]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2016A030313605]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31401499],"Supported by the Science and the Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (grant no. 2014A020212195), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (grant no. 2016A030313605), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.31401499).",8,Nov-27,2017,7,,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00488,Immunology; Microbiology

Reviews have been published by individuals who are consultants and employees of companies commercializing glyphosate-based herbicides in support of glyphosate's reapproval by regulatory agencies. These authors conclude that glyphosate is safe at levels below regulatory permissible limits. In contrast, reviews conducted by academic scientists independent of industry report toxic effects below regulatory limits, as well as shortcomings of the current regulatory evaluation of risks associated with glyphosate exposures. Two authors in particular (Samsel and Seneff) have published a series of commentaries proposing that long-term exposure to glyphosate is responsible for many chronic diseases (including cancers, diabetes, neuropathies, obesity, asthma, infections, osteoporosis, infertility, and birth defects). The aim of this review is to examine the evidential basis for these claimed negative health effects and the mechanisms that are alleged to be at their basis. We found that these authors inappropriately employ a deductive reasoning approach based on syllogism. We found that their conclusions are not supported by the available scientific evidence. Thus, the mechanisms and vast range of conditions proposed to result from glyphosate toxicity presented by Samsel and Seneff in their commentaries are at best unsubstantiated theories, speculations, or simply incorrect. This misrepresentation of glyphosate's toxicity misleads the public, the scientific community, and regulators. Although evidence exists that glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic below regulatory set safety limits, the arguments of Samsel and Seneff largely serve to distract rather than to give a rational direction to much needed future research investigating the toxicity of these pesticides, especially at levels of ingestion that are typical for human populations.","[Mesnage, Robin; Antoniou, Michael N.] Kings Coll London, Dept Med & Mol Genet, Fac Life Sci & Med, Gene Express & Therapy Grp,Guys Hosp, London, England",,,11,Nov-24,2017,5,,10.3389/fpubh.2017.00316,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Additionally, trees act as vectors spreading bacterial cells in the air in urban environments due to the density of microbial cells on aerial plant surfaces. Characterizing tree leaf bacterial communities along an urban gradient is thus key to understand the impact of anthropogenic pressures on urban tree-bacterium interactions and on the overall urban microbiome. In this study, we aimed (i) to characterize phyllosphere bacterial communities of seven tree species in urban environments and (ii) to describe the changes in tree phyllosphere bacterial community structure and diversity along a gradient of increasing urban intensity and at two degrees of tree isolation. Our results indicate that, as anthropogenic pressures increase, urban leaf bacterial communities show a reduction in the abundance of the dominant class in the natural plant microbiome, the Alphaproteobacteria. Our work in the urban environment here reveals that the structures of leaf bacterial communities differ along the gradient of urban intensity. The diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities increases at higher urban intensity, also displaying a greater number and variety of associated indicator taxa than the low and medium urban gradient sites. In conclusion, we find that urban environments influence tree bacterial community composition, and our results suggest that feedback between human activity and plant microbiomes could shape urban microbiomes. IMPORTANCE In natural forests, tree leaf surfaces host diverse bacterial communities whose structure and composition are primarily driven by host species identity. Tree leaf bacterial diversity has also been shown to influence tree community productivity, a key function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, most urban microbiome studies have focused on the built environment, improving our understanding of indoor microbial communities but leaving much to be understood, especially in the nonbuilt microbiome. Here, we provide the first multiple-species comparison of tree phyllosphere bacterial structures and diversity along a gradient of urban intensity. We demonstrate that urban trees possess characteristic bacterial communities that differ from those seen with trees in nonurban environments, with microbial community structure on trees influenced by host species identity but also by the gradient of urban intensity and by the degree of isolation from other trees. Our results suggest that feedback between human activity and plant microbiomes could shape urban microbiomes.","[Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle; Messier, Christian; Kembel, Steven W.] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle; Messier, Christian; Kembel, Steven W.] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Calgary, AB, Canada",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"Financial support was obtained from grants contributed by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), by the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT), and by the Canada Research Chairs Program.",5,NOV-DEC,2017,2,6,10.1128/mSystems.00087-17,Microbiology

Exposome science examines the total accumulated environmental exposures (both detrimental and beneficial) as a means to understand the response of the 'total organism to the total environment' over time. The repetitive stimulation of compensatory physiological responses (immune, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine) in response to stress including sources of stress highly relevant to socioeconomic disadvantage - may lead to metabolic dysregulation and cellular damage, ultimately influencing behavior and disease. The collective toll of physiological wear and tear, known as allostatic load, is not paid equally throughout developed societies. It is paid in excess by the disadvantaged. In the context of fast-food, human and experimental research demonstrates that the biological response to a single fast-food-style meal-especially as mediated by the microbiome-is a product of the person's total lived experience, including the ability to buffer the fast-food meal-induced promotion of inflammation and oxidative stress. Emerging research indicates that each meal and its nutritional context matters. As we discuss, equal weekly visits to major fast-food outlets by the affluent and deprived do not translate into biological equivalency. Hence, debate concerning reducing fast-food outlets through policy-especially in disadvantaged neighborhoods where they are prevalent- requires a biological context. The fast-food establishment and fast-food meal- as they represent matters of food justice and press upon non-communicable disease risk-are far more than physical structures and collections of carbohydrate, fat, sugar and sodium.

While the hypothalamus controls both feeding behavior and the stress response, the integration of the neural control centers and the peripheral gut allows for disruption in the gastrointestinal systems and dysfunctional communication to the brain. Objective: The purpose of this review is to familiarize clinicians with the physiology controlling feeding behavior and its implications for psychiatric conditions, such as anorexia nervosa and depression. Growing understanding of how integrated bacterial life is in the body has shown that gut bacteria regulate basic physiologic processes and are implicated in various disease states and contribute to regulation of mood. Responses to stress have effects on feeding behavior and mood and the regulation of the stress response by the gut microbiota could contribute to the dysfunction seen in patients with psychiatric illnesses. Conclusions: Gut microbiota may contribute to dysfunction in psychiatric illnesses.

Postpartum sleep deprivation and unmet dietary needs can alter commensal bacteria within the body and disrupt gut-brain communication. Perineal injury and breast infections also change microbial community composition, potentiating an environment favoring pathogen growth. The gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms working in harmony. Disruptions within the gut microbiome and gut-brain communication may lead to postpartum depression, a potentially devastating sequela. Postnatal newborn changes to the gut and skin microbiome materialize quickly after birth and are profoundly influenced by mode of birth, feeding method, and bathing and skin care practices. During the newborn period, infant microbiomes are highly vulnerable and susceptible to multiple influences.

Emerging evidence shows that intestinal microflora from ASD subjects can be distinguished from controls, suggesting metabolite differences due to the action of intestinal microbes may provide a means for identifying potential biomarkers for ASD. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine if quantitative differences in levels of stercobilin and stercobilinogen, metabolites produced by biological action of intestinal microflora, exist in the fecal matter between an ASD mouse model population and controls. Methods Pairs of fecal samples were collected from two mouse groups, an ASD model group with Timothy syndrome 2 (TS2-NEO) and a gender-matched control group. After centrifugation, supernatant was spiked with an O-18-labeled stercobilin isotopomer and subjected to solid phase extraction for processing. Extracted samples were spotted on a stainless steel plate and subjected to matrixassisted laser desorption and ionization mass spectrometry using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix (n = 5). Peak areas for bilins and O-18-stercobilin isotopomers were determined in each fecal sample. Results A 40-45% depletion in stercobilin in TS2NEO fecal samples compared with controls was observed with p < 0.05; a less dramatic depletion was observed for stercobilinogen. Conclusions The results show that stercobilin depletion in feces is observed for an ASD mouse model versus controls. This may help to explain recent observations of a less diverse microbiome in humans with ASD and may prove helpful in developing a clinical ASD biomarker.","[Sekera, Emily R.; Rudolph, Heather L.; Carro, Stephen D.; Wood, Troy D.] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Chem, Nat Sci Complex, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Rudolph, Heather L.] Gen Mills, Buffalo, NY USA; [Morales, Michael J.; Bett, Glenna C.

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification make it an unusually well-preserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens. Objective We present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach. Methods Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and UPLC-MS/MS for further characterization of metabolites and lipids. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss. Results Dipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that certain metabolite classes have higher potential for recovery over long time scales and may serve as appropriate targets for oral microbiome evolutionary studies.","[Velsko, Irina M.; Frantz, Laurent A.

We suggest that the mutual constitution of the relations at stake in and around questions of nutrition, mothers and infants, the gut and sanitation in Khayelitsha, can be understood through a Deleuzian geomorphological image of strata of the political. Strata are conjunctural entanglements that temporarily stabilise when distinctions hold briefly, and that bring into alignment particular relations and forces that distribute life and non-life. This analytic makes visible and available to political life the spatio-temporal, socio-natural blurring of categories that epigenetic and microbiomic discourses could afford.

Stool 16S rRNA cDNA libraries from 85 subjects ranging in age (43-79) and FI 34 score (0-0.365) were deep sequenced, denoised, and clustered using DADA2. Subject biological age but not chronological age correlated with a decrease in stool microbial diversity. Specific microbial genera were differentially abundant in the lower, middle, and upper 33rd percentiles of biological age. Using Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference (SPIEC-EASI) and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we identified modules of coabundant microbial genera that distinguished biological from chronological aging. A biological age-associated module composed of Eggerthella, Ruminococcus, and Coprobacillus genera was robust to correction for subject age, sex, body mass index, antibiotic usage, and other confounders. Subject FI 34 score positively correlated with the abundance of this module, which exhibited a distinct inferred metagenome as predicted by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt).

This ""seeding"" or transfer of microbes from the mother to newborn may serve as an early inoculation process with implications for the long-term health outcomes of newborns. Studies have shown that there are distinct differences in the microbiome profiles of newborns born vaginally compared with those born by cesarean. Antibiotic exposure has been shown to alter the microbial profiles of women and may influence the gut microbial profiles of their newborns. Considering that the first major microbial colonization occurs at birth, it is essential that labor and birth nurses be aware of factors that may alter the composition of the microbiome during the labor and birth process.

Treatment is presently dominated by pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy; however, such treatments avert less than half of the disease burden, suggesting that additional strategies are needed to prevent and treat mental disorders. There are now consistent mechanistic, observational and interventional data to suggest diet quality may be a modifiable risk factor for mental illness. This review provides an overview of the nutritional psychiatry field. It includes a discussion of the neurobiological mechanisms likely modulated by diet, the use of dietary and nutraceutical interventions in mental disorders, and recommendations for further research. Potential biological pathways related to mental disorders include inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications and neuroplasticity. Consistent epidemiological evidence, particularly for depression, suggests an association between measures of diet quality and mental health, across multiple populations and age groups; these do not appear to be explained by other demographic, lifestyle factors or reverse causality. Our recently published intervention trial provides preliminary clinical evidence that dietary interventions in clinically diagnosed populations are feasible and can provide significant clinical benefit. Furthermore, nutraceuticals including n-3 fatty acids, folate, S-adenosylmethionine, N-acetyl cysteine and probiotics, among others, are promising avenues for future research. Continued research is now required to investigate the efficacy of intervention studies in large cohorts and within clinically relevant populations, particularly in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar and anxiety disorders.","[Marx, Wolfgang] La Trobe Univ, Sch Allied Hlth, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Moseley, Genevieve; Berk, Michael; Jacka, Felice] Deakin Univ, Food & Mood Ctr, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Sch Med,Barwon Hlth, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael; Jacka, Felice] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Natl Ctr Excellence Youth Hlth, Orygen, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Adolescent Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice] Black Dog Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia","NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1059660, 1108125]",M.

Imbalances in the enteric microbiome have been associated with ASD and can cause GI dysfunction potentially through disruption of mitochondrial function as microbiome metabolites modulate mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dysfunction is highly associated with GI symptoms. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in rectal and cecum biopsies under the assumption that certain microbiome metabolites, such as butyrate and propionic acid, are more abundant in the cecum as compared to the rectum. Rectal and cecum mucosal biopsies were collected during elective diagnostic colonoscopy. Using a single-blind case-control design, complex I and IV and citrate synthase activities and complex I-V protein quantity from 10 children with ASD, 10 children with Crohn's disease and 10 neurotypical children with nonspecific GI complaints were measured. The protein for all complexes, except complex II, in the cecum as compared to the rectum was significantly higher in ASD samples as compared to other groups. For both rectal and cecum biopsies, ASD samples demonstrated higher complex I activity, but not complex IV or citrate synthase activity, compared to other groups. Mitochondrial function in the gut mucosa from children with ASD was found to be significantly different than other groups who manifested similar GI symptomatology suggesting a unique pathophysiology for GI symptoms in children with ASD. Abnormalities localized to the cecum suggest a role for imbalances in the microbiome, potentially in the production of butyrate, in children with ASD.","[Rose, Shannon; Bennuri, Sirish C.; Frye, Richard Eugene] Arkansas Childrens Res Inst, Autism Res Program, Little Rock, AR 72202 USA; [Murray, Katherine F.; Winter, Harland] MassGen Hosp Children, Dept Pediat Gastroenterol & Nutr, Boston, MA USA; [Buie, Timothy] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Boston, MA USA","Arkansas Biosciences Institute (Little Rock, AR); Autism Research Institute","This research was supported by the Arkansas Biosciences Institute (Little Rock, AR) to REF, Autism Research Institute to HW, and philanthropic support from Martin Schlaff (HW).

There is growing awareness that ASD is highly comorbid with gastrointestinal distress and altered intestinal microbiome, and that host-microbiome interactions may contribute to the disease symptoms. However, the paucity of knowledge on gut-brain axis signaling in autism constitutes an obstacle to the development of precision microbiota-based therapeutics in ASD. To this end, we explored the interactions between intestinal microbiota, gut physiology and social behavior in a BTBR T+ Itpr3(tf)/J mouse model of ASD. Here we show that a reduction in the relative abundance of very particular bacterial taxa in the BTBR gut-namely, bile-metabolizing Bifidobacterium and Blautia species,-is associated with deficient bile acid and tryptophan metabolism in the intestine, marked gastrointestinal dysfunction, aswell as impaired social interactions in BTBR mice. Together these data support the concept of targeted manipulation of the gut microbiota for reversing gastrointestinal and behavioral symptomatology in ASD, and offer specific plausible targets in this endeavor.

This article describes new developments in brain-gut interactions as an introduction to a special issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, based on a joint symposium of the American Psychosomatic Society and the American Gastroenterological Association. Literature review articles indicate that several psychiatric disorders are associated with altered gut microbiota, whereas evidence linking functional gastrointestinal disorders and dysbiosis has not been firmly established. The association between dysbiosis with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus is still inconclusive, but evidence suggests that bariatric surgery may favorably alter the gut microbial community structure. Consistent with the literature linking psychiatric disorders with dysbiosis is that life adversity during childhood and certain temperaments that develop early in life are associated with altered gut microbiota, particularly the Prevotella species. Some studies reported in this issue support the hypothesis that brain-gut interactions are adversely influenced by reduced functional activation of the hippocampus and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The evidence for the effects of probiotics in the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis is relatively well established, but effects on mental health and psychophysiological stress reactivity are either inconclusive or still in progress. To conceptualize brain-gut interactions, a holistic, systems-based perspective on health and disease is needed, integrating gut microbial with environmental ecology. More translational research is needed to examine the mental and physical health effects of prebiotics and probiotics, in well-phenotyped human populations with sufficiently large sample sizes.","[Mayer, Emeran A.; Hsiao, Elaine Y.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, G Oppenheimer Ctr Neurobiol Stress & Resilience, Vatche & Tamar Manoukian Div Digest Dis, Microbiome Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA,"The authors received no funding related to this article.

We now have a deepening appreciation of their critical influences in our health maintenance, including energy harvest, metabolism, intestinal development, cell proliferation, nervous system and immune function, as well as their role to protect against intestinal and other infections. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal diseases but particularly with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Although such association does not imply causation, it has been shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic and recurring CDI and that FMT can effect a seemingly safe and rapidly effective cure for most patients with CDI so treated. FMT has been used to treat a wide range of other diseases, although conclusions about efficacy in any disease other than CDI must await appropriate well-designed trials. More work needs to be conducted with FMT, especially to evaluate and ensure its long-term safety. Future studies are likely to narrow the spectrum of organisms that needs to be given to patients to cure CDI, and perhaps other diseases, and to elucidate the mechanisms whereby such therapeutic benefit occurs. FMT is but the first step in this journey.","[Brandt, Lawrence J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA",,,5,OCT,2017,79,8,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000511,"Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology, Multidisciplinary"

In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of the brain-gut axis in relation to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Methods: A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate GI and brain interactions. Results: Evidence suggests reduced microbial diversity in obesity and metabolic dysregulation. However, findings of microbiota composition in obese individuals are inconsistent, and the investigation of causality between gut microbiota and energy homeostasis is complex because multiple variables contribute to the gut microbiota composition. The microbial metabolites short chain fatty acids are found to exert numerous physiologic effects, including energy homeostasis through the regulation of GI hormones such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, and leptin. Preclinical studies show that modifying rodents' microbiota through fecal transplantation results in alterations of these GI hormones and subsequently an altered metabolism and behavior. However, whether and to what extent preclinical findings translate to human metabolism is unclear. Conclusions: One of the major limitations and challenges in this field of research is interindividual variability of the microbiome. Future research needs to combine recent insights gained into tracking the dynamics of the microbiome as well as the metabolic responses. Furthermore, advanced mapping of the human microbiome is required to investigate the metabolic implications of the gut-brain axis to develop targeted interventions for obesity and metabolic syndrome.","[de Clercq, Nicolien C.; Frissen, Myrthe N.; Groen, Albert K.; Nieuwdorp, Max] Acad Med Ctr, Dept Internal & Vasc Med, Room F4-159-2,Meibergdreef 9, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nieuwdorp, Max] Free Univ Medicalenter, VUmc Diabet Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Groen, Albert K.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Pediat, Groningen, Netherlands; [Groen, Albert K.; Nieuwdorp, Max] Univ Gothenburg, Wallenberg Lab, Gothenburg, Sweden",ZONMW-VIDINetherlands Organization for Health Research and Development [016.146.327]; CVON Young Talent grant,This study was supported by a ZONMW-VIDI grant 2013 (016.146.327) and CVON Young Talent grant 2012.

Although bariatric surgery results in sustained weight loss, decreased appetite, and hedonic eating, it is unknown whether the surgery-induced alterations in gut microbiota play a role in the observed changes in hedonic eating. We explored the following hypotheses: (1) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) results in changes in gut microbial composition; (2) alterations in gut microbiota are related to weight loss; (3) alterations in gut microbiome are associated with changes in appetite and hedonic eating. Methods: Eight obese women underwent LSG. Their body mass index, body fat mass, food intake, hunger, hedonic eating scores, and stool samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month postsurgery. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on stool samples. DESeq2 changes in microbial abundance. Multilevel-sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was applied to genus-level abundance for discriminative microbial signatures. Results: LSG resulted in significant reductions in body mass index, food intake, and hedonic eating. A microbial signature composed of five bacterial genera discriminated between pre-and postsurgery status. Several bacterial genera were significantly associated with weight loss (Bilophila, q = 3E-05; Faecalibacterium q = 4E-05), lower appetite (Enterococcus, q = 3E-05), and reduced hedonic eating (Akkermansia, q =.037) after surgery. Conclusions: In this preliminary analysis, changes in gut microbial abundance discriminated between pre-and postoperative status. Alterations in gut microbiome were significantly associated with weight loss and with reduced hedonic eating after surgery; however, a larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.","[Sanmiguel, Claudia P.; Gupta, Arpana; Ju, Tiffany; Stains, Jean; Coveleskie, Kristen; Mayer, Emeran A.; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ingest Behav & Obes Program, Oppenheimer Ctr Neurobiol Stress & Resilience, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Balioukova, Anna; Chen, Yijun; Dutson, Erik] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Surg, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sanmiguel, Claudia P.; Jacobs, Jonathan; Lagishetty, Venu; Mayer, Emeran A.; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Obes & Metab Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sanmiguel, Claudia P.; Jacobs, Jonathan; Lagishetty, Venu; Mayer, Emeran A.; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Microbiome Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sanmiguel, Claudia P.; Jacobs, Jonathan; Gupta, Arpana; Ju, Tiffany; Stains, Jean; Lagishetty, Venu; Balioukova, Anna; Chen, Yijun; Dutson, Erik; Mayer, Emeran A.; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",NIH/NCATS UCLA CTSIUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000124],"This study is funded in part by the NIH/NCATS UCLA CTSI - UL1TR000124.

The weaning of infants and increased social contact with peers is a developmental stage that is likely to affect the gut microbiome. Methods: Gut bacteria were assessed in 63 rhesus monkeys living in social groups comprised of 4 to 7 individuals. Two groups were assessed prospectively on day 1 and 2 weeks after rehousing away from the mother and group formation. Ten additional groups were assessed at 2 weeks after group establishment. Fecal genomic DNAwas extracted and 16S ribosomal RNA sequenced by IlluminaMiSeq (5 social groups) and 454-amplicon pyrosequencing (7 social groups). Results: Combining weaned infants into small social groups led to a microbial convergence by 2 weeks (p < .001). Diversity analyses indicated more similar community structure within peer groups than across groups (p < .01). Prevotella was the predominant taxon, and its abundance differed markedly across individuals. Indices of richness, microbial profiles, and less abundant taxa were all associated with the Prevotella levels. Functional Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses suggested corresponding shifts in metabolic pathways. Conclusions: The formation of small groups of young rhesus monkeys was associated with significant shifts in the gut microbiota. The profiles were closely associated with the abundance of Prevotella, a predominant taxon in the rhesus monkey gut. Changes in the structure of the gut microbiome are likely to induce differences in metabolic and physiologic functioning.","[Amaral, Wellington Z.; Lubach, Gabriele R.; Coe, Christopher L.] Univ Wisconsin, Harlow Ctr Biol Psychol, 22 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Proctor, Alexandra; Lyte, Mark; Phillips, Gregory J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Vet Med, Ames, IA USA",NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH104198]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [HD080201],This research was supported by grants from the NIMH (MH104198) and NICHD (HD080201).

Methods: Sixty healthy Korean participants (21 men; 27.5[8.1] years, 39 women; 34.5[14.3] years) were asked to answer 60 temperament questions (novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence) from the Korean version of the Temperament and Character Inventory-125. The participants' stool samples were submitted, and relative operational taxonomic units were calculated using 16S rRNA gene-based microarrays. Differences between sexes and age-related effects on the temperament and operational taxonomic unit abundances were determined, and optimal clustering numbers related to enterotypes were examined using connectivity and silhouette width (SW) indexes. Finally, the differences in temperament between enterotypes were examined. Results: There was no significant effect of sex or age on gut microbiota and temperament scores. The hierarchical dendrogram, connectivity, and SW analysis indicated bimodal enterotypes. Bacteroidaceae were more abundant in enterotype 1 (46.24%, N = 45), whereas Prevotellaceae were more abundant in enterotype 2 (43.83%, n = 15). Among the four temperament dimensions, novelty seeking and reward dependence scores were higher in enterotype 1 (10.82[2.99] and 8.07[2.51] points) than in enterotype 2 (8.87[2.42] and 5.73[1.03] points). Conclusions: The results suggest an association between temperament and enterotypes in healthy Korean adults. It is conceivable that this association may develop early in life as a result of biological processes catalyzed by the gut microbiota during infancy.","[Kim, Hojun] Dongguk Univ, Dept Rehabil Med, Korean Med, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Young-Jae] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Diag & Biofunct Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Young-Jae] Kyung Hee Univ Hosp Gangdong, Dept Diag & Biofunct Med, 149 Sangil Dong, Seoul 134727, South Korea",,,3,OCT,2017,79,8,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000459,"Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology, Multidisciplinary"

The apparent sensitivity of the microbiota to perturbations across BPS domains suggests that a broad and inclusive framework is needed to develop applicable knowledge in this emerging area. We outline an ecological framework of the human microbiome by extending the BPS concept to better incorporate environmental and human factors as members of a global, dynamic set of systems that interact over time. Methods: We conducted a selective literature review across disciplines to integrate microbiome research into a BPS framework. Results: The microbiome can be understood in terms of ecological systems encompassing BPS domains at four levels: (a) immediate (molecular, genetic, and neural processes), (b) proximal (physiology, emotion, social integration), (c) intermediate (built environments, behaviors, societal practices), and (d) distal (physical environments, attitudes, and broad cultural, economic, and political factors). The microbiota and host are thus understood in terms of their immediate interactions and the more distal physical and social arenas in which they participate. Conclusions: A BPS ecological paradigm encourages replicable, generalizable, and interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary research and practices that take into account the vast influences on the human microbiome that may otherwise be overlooked or understood out of context. It also underscores the importance of sustainable bioenvironmental, psychological, and social systems that broadly supportmicrobial, neural, and general health.","[Maier, Karl J.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Psychol, 305 Holloway Hall,1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [al'Absi, Mustafa] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [al'Absi, Mustafa] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Biobehav Hlth & Populat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,7,OCT,2017,79,8,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000515,"Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology, Multidisciplinary"

Previous work has shown that dietary supplements with multi-species live microorganisms can influence brain function, including induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and production of brain derived neurotrophic factor, in both young and aged rodents. However, the effect of such dietary supplements on memory processes has been less well documented, particularly in the context of aging. The main aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a long-term dietary supplement with a multi-species live Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60, L. acidophilus CUL21, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 and B. lactis CUL34) on tests of memory and behavioural flexibility in 15-17-month-old male rats. Following behavioural testing, the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was extracted and analysed ex vivo using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to examine brain metabolites. The results showed a small beneficial effect of the dietary supplement on watermaze spatial navigation and robust improvements in long-term object recognition memory and short-term memory for object-in-place associations. Short-term object novelty and object temporal order memory was not influenced by the dietary supplement in aging rats. 1H NMR analysis revealed diet-related regional-specific changes in brain metabolites; which indicated changes in several pathways contributing to modulation of neural signaling. These data suggest that chronic dietary supplement with multi-species live microorganisms can alter brain metabolites in aging rats and have beneficial effects on memory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Several studies provide support for the view that the enteric microbiome influences behavior through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuro-inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship. Finally, and drawing on these independent lines of research, an integrative conceptual model is proposed in which stress-induced enteric dysbiosis and intestinal permeability confer risk for negative mental health outcomes through immunoregulatory, endocrinal, and neural pathways.","[Liu, Richard T.] Brown Univ, Warren Alpert Med Sch, East Providence, RI 02915 USA; [Liu, Richard T.] Bradley Hosp, East Providence, RI USA",National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH101138],Preparation of this article was supported in part by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health through Award R01MH101138.

This is by no means a new theory; Elie Metchnikoff proposed over a century ago that targeting the gut by consuming lactic acid bacteria such as those in yogurt, could improve or delay the onset of cognitive decline associated with ageing. However, there is limited information characterising the relationship between the behavioural and physiological sequelae of ageing and alterations in the gut microbiome. To this end, we assessed the behavioural, physiological and caecal microbiota profile of aged male mice. Older mice (20-21 months old) exhibited deficits in spatial memory and increases in anxiety-like behaviours compared to younger mice (2-3 months old). They also exhibited increased gut permeability, which was directly correlated with elevations in peripheral pro-inflammatory cyto-kines. Furthermore, stress exacerbated the gut permeability of aged mice. Examination of the caecal microbiota revealed significant increases in phylum TM7, family Porphyromonadaceae and genus Odoribacter of aged mice. This represents a shift of aged microbiota towards a profile previously associated with inflammatory disease, particularly gastrointestinal and liver disorders. Furthermore, Porphyromonadaceae, which has also been associated with cognitive decline and affective disorders, was directly correlated with anxiety -like behaviour in aged mice. These changes suggest that changes in the gut microbiota and associated increases in gut permeability and peripheral inflammation may be important mediators of the impairments in behavioural, affective and cognitive functions seen in ageing.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) given in pregnancy and postpartum on symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety in the postpartum period. This was a secondary outcome, the primary outcome being eczema in the offspring at 12 months of age. Design, Setting, Participants: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of HN001 on postnatal mood was conducted in 423 women in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand. Women were recruited at 14-16 weeks gestation. Intervention: Women were randomised to receive either placebo or HN001 daily fromenrolment until 6 months postpartum if breastfeeding. Outcome Measures: Modified versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Trait Anxiety Inventory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety postpartum. Trial Registration: Australia NZ Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12612000196842. Findings: 423 womenwere recruited between December 2012 and November 2014. 212 womenwere randomised to HN001 and 211 to placebo. 380 women (89.8%) completed the questionnaire on psychological outcomes, 193 (91.0%) in the treatment group and 187 (88.6%) in the placebo group. Mothers in the probiotic treatment group reported significantly lower depression scores (HN001 mean= 7.7 (SD = 5.4), placebo 9.0 (6.0); effect size-1.2, (95% CI-2.3,-0.1), p= 0.037) and anxiety scores (HN001 12.0 (4.0), placebo 13.0 (4.0); effect size-1.0 (-1.9, -0.2), p = 0.014) than those in the placebo group. Rates of clinically relevant anxiety on screening (score N 15) were significantly lower in the HN001 treated mothers (OR = 0.44 (0.26, 0.73), p = 0.002). Interpretation: Women who received HN001 had significantly lower depression and anxiety scores in the postpartum period. This probioticmay be useful for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of depression and anxiety postpartum. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: National administrative inpatient discharge data from England (Hospital Episode Statistics) and the USA (National Inpatient Sample) in 2012. Participants: De-identifiable non-obstetric inpatient discharges from the national datasets were used to estimate national CDI incidence in the United States and England using ICD9-CM(008.45) and ICD10(A04.7) respectively. Main outcome measures: The rate of CDI was calculated per 100 000 population using national population estimates. Rate per 100 000 inpatient discharges was also calculated separated by primary and secondary diagnosis of CDI. Age, sex and Elixhauser comorbidities profiles were examined. Results: The USA had a higher rate of CDI compared to England: 115.1/100 000 vs. 19.3/100 000 population (P < 0.001). CDI age profiles differed between the countries (P < 0.001): in England, patients >= 75 years constitute a larger proportion of CDI cases, whilst those aged 25-70 constitute more cases in the US (P < 0.001). Overall adjusted odds of CDI in females compared to males was elevated in both England (odds ratios (OR) 1.26 95% CI [1.21,1.31] P < 0.001) and the USA (OR 1.20 95% CI [1.18,1.22] P < 0.001). The proportion of CDI patients with comorbidities was greater in the USA compared to England apart from dementia, which was greater in England (9.63% vs. 1.25%, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The 2012 inpatient CDI rate within the USA was much higher than in England. Age and comorbidity profiles also differed between CDI patients in both countries. The reasons for this are likely multi-factorial but may reflect national infection control policy.","[King, Alice; Aylin, Paul] Imperial Coll London, Dr Foster Unit, 3 Dorset Rise, London EC4Y 8EN, England; [Mullish, Benjamin H.; Williams, Horace R.

Three central areas require basic and clinical research: (1) how the intestinal microenvironment interacts with the host immune system, central nervous system, and enteric nervous system; (2) the role of the intestinal microenvironment in the pathogenesis of medical and neuropsychiatric disease; and (3) the effects of diet, prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation on the intestinal microenvironment and the treatment of disease. Methods: This review article is based on a symposium convened by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American Psychosomatic Society to foster interest in the role of the intestinal microenvironment in brain-gut communication and pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric and biopsychosocial disorders. The aims were to define the state of the art of the current scientific knowledge base and to identify guidelines and future directions for new research in this area. Results: This review provides a characterization of the intestinal microbial composition and function. We also provide evidence for the interactions between the intestinal microbiome, the host, and the environment. The role of the intestinal microbiome in medical and neuropsychiatric diseases is reviewed as well as the treatment effects of manipulation of the intestinal microbiome.

Although rodent models have demonstrated effects of the gut microbiota on emotional, nociceptive, and social behaviors, there is little translational human evidence to date. In this study, we identify brain and behavioral characteristics of healthy women clustered by gut microbiota profiles. Methods: Forty women supplied fecal samples for 16S rRNA profiling. Microbial clusters were identified using Partitioning Around Medoids. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. Microbiota-based group differences were analyzed in response to affective images. Structural and diffusion tensor imaging provided gray matter metrics (volume, cortical thickness, mean curvature, surface area) as well as fiber density between regions. A sparse Partial Least Square-Discrimination Analysis was applied to discriminate microbiota clusters using white and gray matter metrics. Results: Two bacterial genus-based clusters were identified, one with greater Bacteroides abundance (n = 33) and one with greater Prevotella abundance (n = 7). The Prevotella group showed less hippocampal activity viewing negative valences images. White and gray matter imaging discriminated the two clusters, with accuracy of 66.7% and 87.2%, respectively. The Prevotella cluster was associated with differences in emotional, attentional, and sensory processing regions. For gray matter, the Bacteroides cluster showed greater prominence in the cerebellum, frontal regions, and the hippocampus. Conclusions: These results support the concept of brain-gut-microbiota interactions in healthy humans. Further examination of the interaction between gut microbes, brain, and affect in humans is needed to inform preclinical reports that microbial modulation may affect mood and behavior.","[Tillisch, Kirsten; Mayer, Emeran A.; Gupta, Arpana; Gill, Zafar; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Oppenheimer Ctr Neurobiol Stress & Resilience, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tillisch, Kirsten; Mayer, Emeran A.; Gupta, Arpana; Labus, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mayer, Emeran A.; Gupta, Arpana] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Digest Dis, Psychiat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mayer, Emeran A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Microbiome Ctr, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Tillisch, Kirsten] GLA VHA, Integrat Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Labus, Jennifer S.] UCLA Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Brazeilles, Remi; Le Neve, Boris; Derrien, Muriel] Danone Res, Palaiseau, France; [Vlieg, Johan E.

The mechanisms of signal transmission in the brain-gut-microbiota axis are complex and involve bidirectional communications that enable gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with the microbes. This review assesses the potential usefulness and limitations of the paradigm. Methods: A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate the current knowledge in clinical and preclinical brain-gut-microbiota interactions as related to psychiatric disorders. Results: Most published studies in the field are preclinical, and there is so far a lack of clinical studies. Preliminary studies in psychiatric populations support the view of a dysbiosis in some conditions, but studies are often small scale and marred by potential confounding variables. Preclinical studies support the view that psychobiotics (""bacteria which when ingested in adequate amounts have a positive mental health benefit"") might be of use in treating some patients with mental health difficulties. To date, we have no well-conducted studies in clinical populations, although there are some studies in healthy volunteers. A cocktail of probiotics has been shown to alter brain activity as monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and Bifidobacterium longum was reported to alter brain electrical activity. Conclusions: It has yet to be convincingly demonstrated that the exciting findings of psychobiotic efficacy demonstrated in preclinical models of psychiatric illness will translate to patients.","[Dinan, Timothy G.; Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland","Science Foundation IrelandScience Foundation Ireland [SFI/12/RC/2273]; Health Research Board of Ireland [HRA_POR/2011/23, HRA_POR/2012/32]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [FP7/2007-2013]","No conflicts of interest to declare.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut barrier function, and stress measures. Methods: A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-reportmeasures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as amarker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut barrier integrity. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake. Results: Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (beta = 0.263), valerate (beta = 0.230), isovalerate (beta = 0.231), and isobutyrate (beta = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activitywas related to lower valerate levels (beta = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin. Conclusions: In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin. Despite the rather counterintuitive associations with butyrate, these results point to the need for further research on gut microbiome composition.","[Michels, Nathalie; De Henauw, Stefaan] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Ghent, Belgium; [Van de Wiele, Tom] Univ Ghent, Fac Bio Engn, Lab Microbial Ecol & Technol, Ghent, Belgium",Research Foundation-FlandersFWO [FWO.3E0.2015.0043.01]; Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in FlandersInstitute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) [SBO-120054],This work was supported by the Research Foundation-Flanders (grant number FWO.3E0.2015.0043.01).

This study investigated the gut microbiome in a South African sample of PTSD-affected individuals and trauma-exposed (TE) controls to identify potential differences in microbial diversity or microbial community structure. Methods: The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 was used to diagnose PTSD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. Microbial DNA was extracted from stool samples obtained from 18 individuals with PTSD and 12 TE control participants. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3/V4 amplicons were generated and sequenced. Microbial community structure, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity were analyzed; random forest analysis was used to identify associations between bacterial taxa and PTSD. Results: There were no differences between PTSD and TE control groups in alpha- or beta-diversity measures (e.g., alpha-diversity: Shannon index, t = 0.386, p =.70; beta-diversity, on the basis of analysis of similarities: Bray-Curtis test statistic = -0.033, p =.70); however, random forest analysis highlighted three phyla as important to distinguish PTSD status: Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia.

Caloric restriction represents a known strategy to slow many aging processes, including those involving the immune system. More recently, some changes in the microbiome have been described with aging, while the gut microbiome appears to influence responses to flu vaccination and infection. With these considerations in mind, we used a well-established mouse model of flu infection to explore the impact of flu infection, aging, and caloric restriction on the gut microbiome. Young, middle-aged, and aged caloric restricted (CR) and ad lib fed (AL) mice were examined after a sublethal flu infection. All mice lost 10-20% body weight and, as expected for these early time points, losses were similar at different ages and between diet groups. Cytokine and chemokine levels were also similar with the notable exception of IL-1 alpha, which rose more than fivefold in aged AL mouse serum, while it remained unchanged in aged CR serum. Fecal microbiome phyla abundance profiles were similar in young, middle-aged, and aged AL mice at baseline and at 4 days post flu infection, while increases in Proteobacteria were evident at 7 days post flu infection in all three age groups. CR mice, compared to AL mice in each age group, had increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at all time points. Interestingly, principal coordinate analysis determined that diet exerts a greater effect on the microbiome than age or flu infection. Percentage body weight loss correlated with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria regardless of age, suggesting flu pathogenicity is related to Proteobacteria abundance. Further, several microbial Operational Taxonomic Units from the Bacteroidetes phyla correlated with serum chemokine/cytokines regardless of both diet and age suggesting an interplay between flu-induced systemic inflammation and gut microbiota. These exploratory studies highlight the impact of caloric restriction on fecal microbiome in both young and aged animals, as well as the many complex relationships between flu responses and gut microbiota. Thus, these preliminary studies provide the necessary groundwork to examine how gut microbiota alterations may be leveraged to influence declining immune responses with aging.","[Bartley, Jenna M.; Kuchel, George A.; Haynes, Laura] UConn Ctr Aging, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Bartley, Jenna M.; Haynes, Laura] UConn Hlth, Dept Immunol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Zhou, Xin; Weinstock, George M.] Jackson Lab Genom Med, Farmington, CT USA; [Zhou, Xin; Kuchel, George A.; Weinstock, George M.] UConn Hlth, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Farmington, CT USA","National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01 AG021600]","This study was funded by a National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging grant P01 AG021600 to LH.",10,Sep-20,2017,8,,10.3389/fimmu.2017.01164,Immunology

The gut microbiota can signal to the brain via the immune system, the vagus nerve or other host-microbe interactions facilitated by gut hormones, regulation of tryptophan metabolism and microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA), to influence brain development, function and behavior. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play a role in shaping cognitive networks encompassing emotional and social domains in neurodevelopmental disorders. Drawing upon pre-clinical and clinical evidence, we review the potential role of the gut microbiota in the origins and development of social and emotional domains related to Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. Small preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated gut microbiota alterations in both ASD and schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. However, we await the further development of mechanistic insights, together with large scale longitudinal clinical trials, that encompass a systems level dimensional approach, to investigate whether promising pre-clinical and initial clinical findings lead to clinical relevance.","[Kelly, John R.; Minuto, Chiara; Clarke, Gerard; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat & Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Kelly, John R.; Minuto, Chiara; Cryan, John F.; Clarke, Gerard; Dinan, Timothy G.] Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Cork, Ireland","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland [SFI/12/RC/2273]; Health Research Board (HRB) through Health Research Awards [HRA_POR/2011/23, HRA_POR/2012/32, HRA-POR-2-14-647]; EUEuropean Union (EU) [613979]; NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research FoundationNARSAD [20771]","The APC Microbiome Institute is funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).

We measure differences in child cognitive performance at 4 to 9 years of age between cesarean-born and vaginally-born children (n = 3,666) participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). LSAC is a nationally representative birth cohort surveyed biennially. Using multivariate regression, we control for a large range of confounders related to perinatal risk factors and the socioeconomic advantage associated with cesarean-born children. Across several measures, we find that cesarean-born children perform significantly below vaginally-born children, by up to a tenth of a standard deviation in national numeracy test scores at age 8-9. Estimates from a low-risk sub-sample and lower-bound analysis suggest that the relation is not spuriously related to unobserved confounding. Lower rates of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes that are associated with cesarean birth are found to explain less than a third of the cognitive gap, which points to the importance of other mechanisms such as disturbed gut microbiota. The findings underline the need for a precautionary approach in responding to requests for a planned cesarean when there are no apparent elevated risks from vaginal birth.","[Polidano, Cain; Zhu, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Level 5,Fac Business & Econ Bldg, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bornstein, Joel C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Physiol, Level 6,North Wing,Med Bldg, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life CourseAustralian Research Council [CE140100027],"This research was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course (project number CE140100027).

Few studies have investigated their correlation with polypharmacy, multimorbidity and frailty. To assess it, we analyzed the fecal microbiota from 76 inpatients, aged 83 +/- 8. Microbiome biodiversity (Chao1 index) and relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa were determined by next-generation 16S rRNA microbial profiling. Their correlation with number of drugs, and indexes of multimorbidity and frailty were verified using multivariate linear regression models. The impact of gut microbiota biodiversity on mortality, rehospitalizations and incident sepsis was also assessed after a 2-year follow-up, using Cox regression analysis. We found a significant negative correlation between the number of drugs and Chao1 Index at multivariate analysis. The number of drugs was associated with the average relative abundance of 15 taxa. The drug classes exhibiting the strongest association with single taxa abundance were proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Conversely, frailty and multimorbidity were not significantly associated with gut microbiota biodiversity. Very low Chao1 index was also a significant predictor of mortality, but not of rehospitalizations and sepsis, at follow-up. In aging, polypharmacy may thus represent a determinant of gut microbiota composition, with detrimental clinical consequences.","[Ticinesi, Andrea; Lauretani, Fulvio; Nouvenne, Antonio; Maggio, Marcello; Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Parma, Italy; [Ticinesi, Andrea; Lauretani, Fulvio; Nouvenne, Antonio; Maggio, Marcello; Meschi, Tiziana] Univ Parma, Azienda Osped, Dipartimento Med Geriatr Riabilitat, Parma, Italy; [Milani, Christian; Mancabelli, Leonardo; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea; Turroni, Francesca; Duranti, Sabrina; Mangifesta, Marta; Ferrario, Chiara; Ventura, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Lab Probiogen, Parma, Italy; [Viappiani, Alice] GenProbio Srl, Parma, Italy",GenProbio s.r.l.,"The authors wish to thank GenProbio s.r.l. for financial support of the Laboratory of Probiogenomics.

However, over the last few decades, the frequency of C-section delivery in medium-and high-income countries has rapidly increased worldwide. This review describes the evolution of this procedure in Latin American countries, showing that today more than half of newborns in the region are delivered by C-section. Given that C-section delivery is more expensive than vaginal delivery, its use has increased more rapidly in the private than the public sector; nevertheless, the prevalence of C-section deliveries in the public sector is higher than the WHO's recommendations and continues to increase, representing a growing challenge for Latin America. Although the medium-and long-term consequences of C-section delivery, as opposed to vaginal delivery, on the infant health are unclear, epidemiological studies suggest that it is associated with higher risk of developing asthma, food allergy, type 1 diabetes, and obesity during infancy. These findings are important, as the incidence of these diseases in the Latin American pediatric population is also increasing, particularly obesity. Although the link between these diseases and delivery mode remains controversial, recent studies indicate that the establishment of the gut microbiota is delayed in infants born by C-section during the postnatal period, i.e., during a critical developmental window for the maturation of the newborn's immune system. This delay may favor the subsequent development of inflammatory and metabolic disorders during infancy. Accordingly, from a public health perspective, it is important to slow down and eventually reverse the pattern of increased C-section use in the affected populations.","[Magne, Fabien] Univ Chile, Inst Biomed Sci ICBM, Microbiol & Mycol Program, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Puchi Silva, Alexa] Andres Bello Univ, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Carvajal, Bielka] Univ Chile, Dept Women & Newborns Hlth Promot, Santiago, Chile; [Gotteland, Martin] Univ Chile, Dept Nutr, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Gotteland, Martin] Univ Chile, Inst Nutr & Food Technol INTA, Santiago, Chile",,,16,Sep-04,2017,5,,10.3389/fped.2017.00192,Pediatrics

Evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions is weak. Mounting data indicate that the gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system and the immune system by neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory afferent and efferent pathways. There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota influences weight regulation and psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression. This article reviews how the gut-brain interaction may impact the development and course of AN. A ""leaky gut"", characterized by antigens traversing the intestinal wall, was demonstrated in an animal model of AN, and could underlie the low-grade inflammation and increased risk of autoimmune diseases found in AN. Moreover, starvation has a substantial impact on the gut microbiome, and diets used for re-nutrition based on animal products may support the growth of bacteria capable of triggering inflammation. As there is currently no empirically derived agreement on therapeutic re-nourishment in AN, this review discusses how consideration of gut-brain interactions may be important for treatment regarding the determination of target weight, rapidity of weight gain, refeeding methods and composition of the diet which might all be of importance to improve long-term outcome of one of the most chronic psychiatric disorders of adolescence.","[Herpertz-Dahlmann, Beate; Seitz, Jochen] Tech Univ RWTH, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychosomat & Ps, Univ Clin, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Baines, John] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Expt Med, Plon, Germany; [Baines, John] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Plon, Germany",,,21,SEP,2017,26,9,10.1007/s00787-017-0945-7,"Psychology, Developmental; Pediatrics; Psychiatry"

Furthermore, we discuss the potential mechanisms of elimination diets' effects in these neurodevelopmental disorders. The main candidate mechanism is the microbiome-gut-brain axis possibly involving complex interactions between multiple systems, including the metabolic, immune, endocrine, and neural system.

Recent findings show that the onset and development of these illnesses cannot be well described by the one-gene; one-disease approach. Instead, their clinical presentation is thought to result from the regulative interplay of a large number of genes. Even though the involvement of many genes are likely, up regulating and activation or down regulation and silencing of these genes by the environmental factors play a crucial role in contributing to their pathogenesis. Much of this interplay may be moderated by epigenetic changes. Similar to genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA interference can influence gene expression and therefore may cause behavioral and neuronal changes observed in mental disorders. Environmental factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and infections have significant role in these epigenetic modifications. Studies show that bioactive nutrients and gut microbiota can alter either DNA methylation and histone signatures through a variety of mechanisms. Indeed, microbes within the human gut may play a significant role in the regulation of various elements of gut-brain axis, via their influence on inflammatory cytokines and production of antimicrobial peptides that affect the epigenome through their involvement in generating short chain fatty acids, vitamin synthesis, and nutrient absorption. In addition, they may participate in-gut production of many common neurotransmitters. In this review we will consider the potential interactions of diet, gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation, and epigenetic alterations in psychiatric disorders.","[Alam, Reza; Abdolmaleky, Hamid M.; Zhou, Jin-Rong] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Nutr Metab Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,35,SEP,2017,174,6,10.1002/ajmg.b.32567,Genetics & Heredity; Psychiatry

These measures provide new avenues for discovery and prevention, yet they also raise many challenges for adoption in epidemiological investigations. Here, we evaluate 1) designs to investigate diseases that consider heterogeneous and multidimensional indicators of exposure and behavior, 2) the implementation of numerous methods to capture indicators of exposure, and 3) the analytical methods required for discovery and validation. We find that case-control studies have provided insights into genetic susceptibility but are insufficient for characterizing complex effects of environmental factors on disease development. Prospective and two-phase designs are required but must balance extended data collection with follow-up of study participants. We discuss innovations in assessments including the microbiome; mass spectrometry and metabolomics; behavioral assessment; dietary, physical activity, and occupational exposure assessment; air pollution monitoring; and global positioning and individual sensors. We claim the the availability of extensive correlated data raises new challenges in disentangling specific exposures that influence cancer risk from among extensive and often correlated exposures. In conclusion, new high-dimensional exposure assessments offer many new opportunities for environmental assessment in cancer development.

Animal studies have linked microbiome disruption to changes in cognitive functioning, although no study has examined this possibility in neurologically healthy older adults. Methods: Participants were 43 community-dwelling older adults (50-85 years) that completed a brief cognitive test battery and provided stool samples for gut microbiome sequencing. Participants performing >= 1 SD below normative performance on two or more tests were compared to persons with one or fewer impaired scores. Results: Mann Whitney U tests revealed different distributions of Bacteroidetes (p =.01), Firmicutes (p =.02), Proteobacteria (p =.04), and Verrucomicrobia (p =.003) between Intact and Impaired groups. These phyla were significantly correlated with cognitive test performances, particularly Verrucomicrobia and attention/executive function measures. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that composition of the gut microbiome is associated with cognitive test performance in neurologically healthy older adults.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission and deficits in reward processing and its underlying neuro-circuitry including the ventral striatum. The microbiome might contribute to ADHD etiology via the gut-brain axis. In this pilot study, we investigated potential differences in the microbiome between ADHD cases and undiagnosed controls, as well as its relation to neural reward processing. Methods We used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing (16S) to identify bacterial taxa and their predicted gene functions in 19 ADHD and 77 control participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we interrogated the effect of observed microbiome differences in neural reward responses in a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis. Results For the first time, we describe gut microbial makeup of adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. We found that the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa differed between cases and controls, albeit marginally significant. A nominal increase in the Bifidobacterium genus was observed in ADHD cases. In a hypothesis-driven approach, we found that the observed increase was linked to significantly enhanced 16S-based predicted bacterial gene functionality encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in cases relative to controls. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine. Increased relative abundance of this functionality was significantly associated with decreased ventral striatal fMRI responses during reward anticipation, independent of ADHD diagnosis and age. Conclusions Our results show increases in gut microbiome predicted function of dopamine precursor synthesis between ADHD cases and controls. This increase in microbiome function relates to decreased neural responses to reward anticipation. Decreased neural reward anticipation constitutes one of the hallmarks of ADHD.","[Aarts, Esther; Zwiers, Marcel P.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Ederveen, Thomas H.

Despite its high prevalence, the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms underlying depression still needs to be elucidated.Recent findingsOver the course of the last few years, several neurobiological alterations have been linked to the development and maintenance of depression. One basic process that seems to link many of these findings is inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been associated with both biological factors such as excessive neurotransmitter concentrations as well as psychological processes such as adult stress reactivity and a history of childhood trauma. As a balanced microbial community, modulated by diet, is a key regulator of the host physiology, it seems likely that gut microbiota plays a role in depression.SummaryThe review summarizes the existent literature on this emerging research field and provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted links between the microbiota, diet, and depression. Several pathways linking early life trauma, pharmacological treatment effects, and nutrition to the microbiome in depression are described aiming to foster the psychotherapeutic treatment of depressed patients by interventions targeting the microbiota.","[Koopman, Margreet; El Aidy, Sahar] Univ Groningen, Groningen Biomol Sci & Biotechnol Inst GBB, Microbial Physiol, Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Clin Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Groningen, Netherlands; Asklepios Fachklinikum Tiefenbrunn, Gottingen, Germany; [MIDtrauma Consortium] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Innsbruck, Austria",Rosalind Franklin Fellowship - European Union; Rosalind Franklin Fellowship - University of Groningen,"J.K.D. and S.E.A. are supported by Rosalind Franklin Fellowships, cofunded by the European Union and University of Groningen.",13,SEP,2017,30,5,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000350,Psychiatry

The pathways leading towards the development of BV are not well understood. Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently associated with BV. G. vaginalis produces the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), vaginolysin, which can lyse a variety of human cells and is thought to play a role in pathogenesis. Because membrane cholesterol is required for vaginolysin to function, and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) affect not only serum levels of cholesterol but membrane levels as well, we hypothesized that statins might affect the vaginal microbiome. Methods To investigate the relationship between use of the statins and the vaginal microbiome, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene taxonomic surveys performed on vaginal samples from 133 women who participated in the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project and who were taking statins at the time of sampling, 152 women who reported high cholesterol levels but were not taking statins, and 316 women who did not report high cholesterol. To examine the effect of statins on the cytolytic effect of vaginolysin, the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) produced by Gardnerella vaginalis, we assessed the effect of simvastatin pretreatment of VK2E6/E7 vaginal epithelial cells on vaginolysin-mediated cytotoxicity. Results The mean proportion of G. vaginalis among women taking statins was significantly lower relative to women not using statins. Women using statins had higher mean proportions of Lactobacillus crispatus relative to women with normal cholesterol levels, and higher levels of Lactobacillus jensenii relative to women with high cholesterol but not taking statins. In vitro, vaginal epithelial cells pretreated with simvastatin were relatively resistant to vaginolysin and this effect was inhibited by cholesterol. Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, statin use was associated with reduced proportions of G. vaginalis and greater proportions of beneficial lactobacilli within the vaginal microbiome. The negative association between statin use and G. vaginalis may be related to inhibition of vaginolysin function.","[Abdelmaksoud, Abdallah A.; Garcia, Erin M.; Leftwich, Lauren M.; Sheth, Nihar U.; Bradley, Steven P.; Serrano, Myrna G.; Fettweis, Jennifer M.; Huang, Bernice; Buck, Gregory A.; Jefferson, Kimberly K.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Girerd, Philippe H.; Strauss, Jerome F., III] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Richmond, VA USA; [Brooks, J.

A correct equilibrium between the human host and their microorganisms is important for an appropriate physiological function. Extensive research has shown that microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract-or gut microbiota-are involved not only in both nutritive and digestive activities but also in immunological processes. Moreover, the gut microbiome influences both central nervous system and energy homeostasis. An altered gut microbiome has been associated with the pathophysiology of different diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Apparently, both environmental-diet, exposition to antibiotics, and infections-and host-genetic factors have a strong influence on gut microbiome, modulating the risk for neuropsychiatric illness. Also, early life disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression later in life, suggesting a link between gut microbiome, neurodevelopment, and depression.

Gut microbiota is currently viewed as a key regulator of a fluent bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain (gut-brain axis). A number of preclinical studies have suggested that the microbiota and its genome (microbiome) may play a key role in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, alterations in the gut microbiota composition in humans have also been linked to a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, autism and Parkinson's disease. However, it is not yet clear whether these changes in the microbiome are causally related to such diseases or are secondary effects thereof. In this respect, recent studies in animals have indicated that gut microbiota transplantation can transfer a behavioral phenotype, suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a modifiable factor modulating the development or pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric conditions. Further studies are warranted to establish whether or not the findings of preclinical animal experiments can be generalized to humans. Moreover, although different communication routes between the microbiota and brain have been identified, further studies must elucidate all the underlying mechanisms involved. Such research is expected to contribute to the design of strategies to modulate the gut microbiota and its functions with a view to improving mental health, and thus provide opportunities to improve the management of psychiatric diseases. Here, we review the evidence supporting a role of the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying its contribution to mental illness and health. We also consider the stages of life where the gut microbiota is more susceptible to the effects of environmental stressors, and the possible microbiota-targeted intervention strategies that could improve health status and prevent psychiatric disorders in the near future.","[Carmen Cenit, Maria; Sanz, Yolanda] CSIC, Natl Res Council, Inst Agrochem & Food Technol, IATA,Microbial Ecol Nutr & Hlth Res Grp, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Codoner-Franch, Pilar] Dr Peset Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Ave Gaspar Aguilar 90, Valencia 46017, Spain",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [AGL2014-52101-P]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III at the Spanish Ministry of Health (Spain) [CD14/00237],"Supported by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), No. AGL2014-52101-P; A Sara Borrell postdoctoral fellowship from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III at the Spanish Ministry of Health (Spain), No. CD14/00237 (Cenit MC).",56,Aug-14,2017,23,30,10.3748/wjg.v23.i30.5486,Gastroenterology & Hepatology

Human microbiome research in the past decade has been the field of increasingly intense research much due to its demonstrated impact upon various health conditions including human chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many confounding factors have been revealed to play a role in shaping the microbiome in chronic airway diseases. Asthma and COPD follows a typical pattern of disease progression, which includes stable and exacerbation state in which the microbiota is known to vary. However, many such studies lack extensive and longitudinal sampling with inadequate metadata, which has resulted in the inconsistencies in the observations. HDSS provides such a platform, which can offer a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health. In this review, we highlight opportunities and limitations in microbiome research with the help of studies conducted on chronic airway diseases like asthma and COPD.

The primary source of breast milk glucocorticoids is probably the systemic circulation. Research from our group showed that milk cortisol and cortisone concentrations follow the diurnal rhythm of maternal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, with a higher abundance of cortisone compared to cortisol. Measurement of breast-milk glucocorticoid concentrations is challenging due to possible cross-reactivity with progestagens and sex steroids, which are severely elevated during pregnancy and after parturition. This requires precise methods that are not hindered by cross reactivity, such as LC-MS/MS. There are some data suggesting that breast-milk glucocorticoids could promote intestinal maturation, either locally or after absorption into the systemic circulation. Breast-milk glucocorticoids might also have an effect on the intestinal microbiome, although this has not been studied thus far. Findings from studies investigating the systemic effects of breast-milk glucocorticoids are difficult to interpret, since none took the diurnal rhythm of glucocorticoids in breast milk into consideration, and various analytical methods were used. Nevertheless, glucocorticoids in breast milk might offer a novel potential pathway for signal transmission from mothers to their infants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant bacteriuria, central to most definitions of UTI, has little significance in identifying individuals who will benefit from treatment. Urinary symptoms are similarly uninformative. Neither criterion is well defined. Bacteriuria and symptoms remit and recur spontaneously. Treatment is standard for acute uncomplicated cystitis and common for asymptomatic bacteriuria, but definite benefits are few. Treatment for UTI in older adults with delirium and bacteriuria is widespread but no evidence supports the practice, and expert opinion opposes it. Sensitive diagnostic tests now demonstrate that healthy urinary tracts host a ubiquitous, complex microbial community. Recognition of this microbiome, largely undetectable using standard agar-based cultures, offers a new perspective on UTI. Everyone is bacteriuric. From this perspective, most people who are treated for a UTI would probably be better off without treatment. Elderly adults, little studied in this regard, face particular risk. Invasive bacterial diseases such as pyelonephritis and bacteremic bacteriuria are also UTIs. Mindful decisions about antibiotic use will require a far better understanding of how pathogenicity arises within microbial communities. It is likely that public education and meaningful informed-consent discussions about antibiotic treatment of bacteriuria, emphasizing potential harms and uncertain benefits, would reduce overtreatment. Emphasizing the microbiome's significance and using the term urinary tract dysbiosis instead of UTI might also help and might encourage mindful study of the relationships among host, aging, microbiome, disease, and antibiotic treatment.","[Finucane, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Bayview Med Ctr, 5200 Eastern Ave,MFL C,Suite 2200, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA",,,20,AUG,2017,65,8,10.1111/jgs.14907,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology

As a consequence of this systemic metabolic integration, peripheral inflammation can contribute to accumulation of kynurenine in the brain, which has been associated with depression and schizophrenia. Conversely, kynurenine accumulation can be suppressed by activating kynurenine clearance in exercised skeletal muscle.

Since the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has become increasingly conflated with sterilization. In reviewing studies across the hygiene literature (most often hand hygiene), we found that nearly all studies of hand hygiene utilize bulk reduction in bacterial load as a proxy for reduced transmission of pathogenic organisms. This treatment of hygiene may be insufficient in light of recent microbial ecology research, which has demonstrated that humans have intimate and evolutionarily significant relationships with a diverse assemblage of microorganisms (our microbiota). The human skin is home to a diverse and specific community of microorganisms, which include members that exist across the ecological spectrum from pathogen through commensal to mutualist. Most evidence suggests that the skin microbiota is likely of direct benefit to the host and only rarely exhibits pathogenicity. This complex ecological context suggests that the conception of hygiene as a unilateral reduction or removal of microbes has outlived its usefulness. As such, we suggest the explicit definition of hygiene as ""those actions and practices that reduce the spread or transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, and thus reduce the incidence of disease.""","[Vandegrift, Roo; Bateman, Ashley C.; Siemens, Kyla N.; Nguyen, May; Wilson, Hannah E.; Green, Jessica L.; Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin G.; Hickey, Roxana J.] Univ Oregon, Biol & Built Environm Ctr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Vandegrift, Roo; Bateman, Ashley C.; Siemens, Kyla N.; Wilson, Hannah E.; Green, Jessica L.; Hickey, Roxana J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Nguyen, May; Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin G.] Univ Oregon, Dept Architecture, Energy Studies Bldg Lab, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Dyson Corporation [385420]; Alfred P.

In studying the human microbiome, advances in DNA and RNA sequencing technology offer benefits over traditional culture-based methods. Such technology has permitted more thorough investigations of microbial communities, particularly those of the gastrointestinal (GI) and female reproductive tracts. Although individual variations exist, each site exhibits distinct compositions. The diverse GI microbiota aid in digestion, mood regulation, and vitamin synthesis. While many factors affect the composition and functions of the GI microbiota, diet likely exerts the strongest influence. Vaginal microbiota tend to be less diverse, and mainly serve to protect women from infection. The composition of the vaginal microbiota is influenced by sexual activity, hygienic practices, medications, smoking, and other factors.

Understanding the inter-relationship of signals from within and outside of the liver that trigger liver inflammation is pivotal for development of novel therapeutic targets of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The aim of this paper is to review recent advances in the field of alcohol-induced liver inflammation. A detailed literature review was performed using the PubMed database published between January 1980 and December 2016. We provide an update on the role of intestinal microbiome, metabolome and the gut-liver axis in ALD, discuss the growing body of evidence on the diversity of liver macrophages and their differential contribution to alcohol-induced liver inflammation, and highlight the crucial role of inflammasomes in integration of inflammatory signals in ALD. Studies to date have identified a multitude of new therapeutic targets, some of which are currently being tested in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. These treatments aim to strengthen the intestinal barrier, ameliorate liver inflammation and augment hepatocyte regeneration. Given the complexity of inflammation in ALD, multiple pathobiological mechanisms may need to be targeted at the same time as it seems unlikely that there is a single dominant pathogenic pathway in ALD that would be easily targeted using a single target drug approach. Here, we focus on recent advances in immunopathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), including gut-liver axis, hepatic macrophage activation, sterile inflammation and synergy between bacterial and sterile signals. We propose a multiple parallel hit model of inflammation in ALD and discuss its implications for clinical trials in alcoholic hepatitis.","[Szabo, Gyongyi] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, LRB 215,364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Petrasek, Jan] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Div Digest & Liver Dis, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U01 AA021902, AA021907, AA021893, R01 AA017729]","The study was supported by NIH funded grants U01 AA021902, AA021907, & AA021893 and R01 AA017729 to Dr Gyongyi Szabo.",17,JUL,2017,52,4,10.1093/alcalc/agx025,Substance Abuse

It focuses on current controversies on the potential of ASDs to contribute to infections-bacterial, parasitic, fungal, protozoan and viral, particularly in the elderly, comprehensively and critically discusses the growing body of observational literature linking ASD use to a variety of enteric, respiratory, skin and systemic infectious diseases and complications (Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, septicaemia and other). The proposed pathogenic mechanisms of ASD-associated infections (related and unrelated to the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, alterations of the gut microbiome and immunity), and drug-drug interactions are also described. Both probiotics use and correcting vitamin D status may have a significant protective effect decreasing the incidence of ASD-associated infections, especially in the elderly. Despite the limitations of the existing data, the importance of individualised therapy and caution in long-term ASD use considering the balance of benefits and potential harms, factors that may predispose to and actions that may prevent/attenuate adverse effects is evident. A six-step practical algorithm for ASD therapy based on the best available evidence is presented.","[Fisher, Leon] Frankston Hosp, Peninsula Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fisher, Alexander] Canberra Hosp, ACT Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Fisher, Alexander] Australian Natl Univ, Med Sch, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,,4,JUL,2017,37,7,10.1007/s40261-017-0519-y,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Prolonged energy deficit also impacts physical performance, mood, attentiveness, and decision making capabilities. This study will determine whether maintaining a eugonadal state during severe, sustained energy deficit attenuates physiological decrements and maintains mental performance. This study will also assess the effects of normalizing testosterone levels during severe energy deficit and recovery on gut health and appetite regulation. Methods: Fifty physically active men will participate acclimation phase (protein: 1.6 g.kg(-1).d(-1); fat: 30% total energy intake), participants will be randomized to undergo a 28-d, 55% energy deficit phase with (DEF + TEST: 200 mg testosterone enanthate per week) or without (DEF) exogenous testosterone. Diet and physical activity will be rigorously controlled. Recovery from the energy deficit (ad libitum diet, no testosterone) will be assessed until body mass has been recovered within +/- 2.5% of initial body mass. Body composition, stable isotope methodologies, proteomics, muscle biopsies, whole-room calorimetry, molecular biology, activity/sleep monitoring, personality and cognitive function assessments, functional MRI, and comprehensive biochemistries will be used to assess physiological and psychological responses to energy restriction and recovery feeding while volunteers are in an expected hypogonadal versus eugonadal state. Discussion: The Optimizing Performance for Soldiers (OPS) study aims to determine whether preventing hypogonadism will mitigate declines in physical and mental function that typically occur during prolonged energy deficit, and the efficacy of testosterone replacement on recovery from severe underfeeding.","[Pasiakos, Stefan M.; Berryman, Claire E.; Karl, J.

It identifies a common ontology of socio-ecological systems marked by anthropogenic absences and tipped across thresholds into less desirable states. It examines the operation of an environmental mode of biopower associated with deliberate efforts to engineer ecologies through the introduction of keystone species.

Worldwide, the status of children's health has changed in recent decades. Some studies have attempted to identify the causes of these changes and whether they relate to pollutant exposure; however, such attempts have faced major challenges because human life is complex, involving many social and environmental factors. Several long-term cohort studies are being conducted to determine the relationship between diseases and social and environmental factors in children. Even before we establish complete proof of adverse effects, we should attempt to decrease risk to future generations by adopting precautionary principles. Environmental exposure to persistent organic pollutants can be reduced throughout the stages of life-the fetal period, newborn and infant periods, childhood, adolescence and adulthood (preconception) by individuals as well as by society as a whole. Through reducing environmental exposure to pollutants, adverse health effects can also be reduced, which will contribute to healthier future generations. Here, we suggest a virtuous cycle for improving the health of future generations through reduced exposure to persistent pollutants.","[Mori, Chisato] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Bioenvironm Med, Chiba, Japan; [Mori, Chisato; Todaka, Emiko] Chiba Univ, Ctr Prevent Med Sci, Chiba, Japan","MEXT KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H01781]","This work was supported by MEXT KAKENHI, grant number JP16H01781.",2,JUL,2017,71,7,10.1136/jech-2016-208088,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Metagenomic studies on anorexia nervosa have revealed profound gut microbiome perturbations as a possible environmental factor involved in the disease. In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis integrating data on gut microbiota with clinical, anthropometric and psychological traits to gain new insight in the pathophysiology of AN. Fifteen AN women were compared with fifteen age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. AN diet was characterized by a significant lower energy intake, but macronutrient analysis highlighted a restriction only in fats and carbohydrates consumption. Next generation sequencing showed that AN intestinal microbiota was significantly affected at every taxonomic level, showing a significant increase of Enterobacteriaceae, and of the archeon Methanobrevibactersmithiicompared with healthy controls. On the contrary, the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus and Clostridium, were depleted, in line with the observed reduction in AN of total short chain fatty acids, butyrate, and propionate. Butyrate concentrations inversely correlated with anxiety levels, whereas propionate directly correlated with insulin levels and with the relative abundance of Roseburia inulinivorans, a known propionate producer. BMI represented the best predictive value for gut dysbiosis and metabolic alterations, showing a negative correlation with Bacteroides uniformis (microbiota), with alanine aminotransferase (liver function), and with psychopathological scores (obsession-compulsion, anxiety, and depression), and a positive correlation with white blood cells count. In conclusion, our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the gut dysbiosis could take part in the AN neurobiology, in particular in sustaining the persistence of alterations that eventually result in relapses after renourishment and psychological therapy, but causality still needs to be proven.","[Borgo, Francesca; Riva, Alessandra; Garbossa, Stefania; Scarone, Silvio; Pontiroli, Antonio E.; Morace, Giulia; Borghi, Elisa] Univ Milan, Dept Hlth Sci, Milan, Italy; [Benetti, Alberto; Bertelli, Sara; Garbossa, Stefania; Anselmetti, Simona; Scarone, Silvio; Pontiroli, Antonio E.] ASST St Paolo & Carlo, Milan, Italy; [Casiraghi, Maria Cristina] Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutr Sci, Milan, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Milano,"This study was supported by the Universita degli Studi di Milano.

Probiotics can have dramatic effects on behaviour through the microbiome-gut-brain axis, through vagus nerve. We investigated whether chronic probiotic intake could modulate psychological state, eating behaviour and body composition of normal weight obese (NWO) and preobese-obese (PreOB/OB) compared to normal weight lean women (NWL). Methods: 60 women were enrolled. At baseline and after a 3-week probiotic oral suspension (POS) intake, all subjects underwent evaluation of body composition by anthropometry and dual X-ray absorptiometry, and psychological profile assessment by self-report questionnaires (i.e. EDI-2, SCL90R and BUT). Statistical analysis was carried out using paired t test or a non-parametric Wilcoxon test to evaluate differences between baseline and after POS intake, one-way ANOVA to compare all three groups and, where applicable, Chi square or t test were used to assess symptoms. Results: Of the 48 women that concluded the study, 24% were NWO, 26% were NWL and 50% were PreOB/OB. Significant differences in body composition were highlighted among groups both at baseline and after a POS (p < 0.05). After POS intake, a significant reduction of BMI, resistance, FM (kg and %) (p < 0.05), and a significant increase of FFM (kg and %) (p < 0.05) were observed in all subjects in NOW and PreOB/OB. After POS intake, reduction of bacterial overgrowth syndrome (p < 0.05) and lower psychopathological scores (p < 0.05) were observed in NWO and PreOB/OB women. At baseline and after POS intake, all subjects tested were negative to SCL90R_GSI scale, but after treatment subjects positive to BUT_GSI scale were significantly reduced (8.33%) (p < 0.05) compared to the baseline (33.30%). In NWO and PreOB/OB groups significant differences (p < 0.05) in response to the subscales of the EDI-2 were observed. Significant improvement of the orocecal transit time was observed (p < 0.05) after POS intake. Furthermore, significant differences were observed for meteorism (p < 0.05) and defecation frequency (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A 3-week intake of selected psychobiotics modulated body composition, bacterial contamination, psychopathological scores of NWO and PreOB/OB women.

There is a growing body of literature that implicates a role of the gut microbiota in the etiology and progression of these conditions. Gut bacteria may act on the gut-brain axis to alter appetite control and brain function as part of the genesis of eating disorders. As the illnesses progress, extreme feeding patterns and psychological stress potentially feed back to the gut ecosystem that can further compromise physiological, cognitive, and social functioning. Given the established causality between dysbiosis and metabolic diseases, an altered gut microbial profile is likely to play a role in the co-morbidities of eating disorders with altered immune function, short-chain fatty acid production, and the gut barrier being the key mechanistic links. Understanding the role of the gut ecosystem in the pathophysiology of eating disorders will provide critical insights into improving current treatments and developing novel microbiome-based interventions that will benefit patients with eating disorders.","[Lam, Yan Y.; Maguire, Sarah; Palacios, Talia; Caterson, Ian D.] Univ Sydney, Boden Inst Obes Nutr & Eating Disorders, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Lam, Yan Y.] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",,,12,JUN,2017,9,6,10.3390/nu9060602,Nutrition & Dietetics

It also poses important ethical concerns. This study is an attempt to assess clinicians' perception and attitudes towards ethical and social challenges raised by fecal microbiota transplantation. Methods: A questionnaire was developed which consisted of 20 items: four items covered general aspects, nine were about ethical aspects such as informed consent and privacy issues, four concerned social and regulatory issues, and three were about an FMT bank. This was distributed to participants at the Second China gastroenterology and FMT conference in May 2015. Basic descriptive statistical analyses and simple comparative statistical tests were performed. Results: Nearly three quarters of the 100 respondents were gastro-enterologist physicians. 89% of all respondents believed FMT is a promising treatment modality for some diseases and 88% of whom chose clinical efficacy as the primary reason for recommending FMT. High expectation from patients and pressure on clinicians (33%) was reported as the most frequent reasons for not recommending FMT. The clinicians who had less familiarity with FMT reported significantly more worry related to the dignity and psychological impact of FMT compared to those who have high familiarity with FMT (51.6% vs 27.8%, p = 0.021). More than half of the respondents (56.1%) were concerned about the commercialization of FMT, although almost one in five respondents did not see this as a problem. Conclusions: We found most respondents have positive attitudes towards FMT but low awareness of published evidence. Informed consent for vulnerable patients, privacy and protection of donors were perceived as the most challenging ethical aspects of FMT. This study identified areas of limited knowledge and ways of addressing ethical issues and indicates the need to devise the education and training for clinicians on FMT.","[Ma, Yonghui] Xiamen Univ, Med Coll, Ctr Bioeth, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jinqiu] Xiamen Univ, Med Coll, Dept Nursing, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Cui, Bota; Zhang, Faming] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Med Ctr Digest Dis, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hongzhi; Xiao, Chuanxing] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Xiamen, Peoples R China",China National Social Science Foundation [16CZX064],This study was supported by China National Social Science Foundation (16CZX064).,8,May-31,2017,18,,10.1186/s12910-017-0200-2,"Ethics; Medical Ethics; Social Sciences, Biomedical"

In this sense, the challenge of Systems Biology for understanding the ""psychiatric phenotype"" is to provide an improved vision of the shape of the phenotype as it is visualized by ""Gestalt"" psychology, whose fundamental axiom is that the observed phenotype (behavior or mental disorder) will be the result of the integrative composition of every part. Therefore, we propose the term ""Gestaltomics"" as a term from Systems Biology to integrate data coming from different sources of information (such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, metabolome, phenome, and microbiome). In addition to this biological complexity, the mind is integrated through multiple brain functions that receive and process complex information through channels and perception networks (i.e., sight, ear, smell, memory, and attention) that in turn are programmed by genes and influenced by environmental processes (epigenetic). Today, the approach of medical research in human diseases is to isolate one disease for study; however, the presence of an additional disease (co-morbidity) or more than one disease (multimorbidity) adds complexity to the study of these conditions. This review will present the challenge of integrating psychiatric disorders at different levels of information (Gestaltomics). The implications of increasing the level of complexity, for example, studying the co-morbidity with another disease such as cancer, will also be discussed.","[Gutierrez Najera, Nora A.; Resendis-Antonio, Osbaldo; Nicolini, Humberto] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Resendis-Antonio, Osbaldo] Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Human Syst Biol Lab, Coordinac Invest Cient Red Apoyo Invest, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","CONACYT, MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [SALUD-2015-2, 261516]","The present study was supported by CONACYT, Mexico.

The study of ancient microorganisms in mineralized dental plaque or calculi is providing insights into microbial evolution, as well as lifestyles and disease states of extinct cultures; yet, little is still known about the oral microbial community structure and function of pre-Columbian Caribbean cultures. In the present study, we investigated the dental calculi microbiome and predicted function of one of these cultures, known as the Saladoid. The Saladoids were horticulturalists that emphasized root-crop production. Fruits, as well as small marine and terrestrial animals were also part of the Saladoid diet. Methods. Dental calculi samples were recovered from the archaeological site of Sorce, in the municipal island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, characterized using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, and compared to the microbiome of previously characterized coprolites of the same culture, as well modern plaque, saliva and stool microbiomes available from the Human Microbiome Project. Results. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes comprised the majority of the Saladoid dental calculi microbiome. The Saladoid dental calculi microbiome was distinct when compared to those of modern saliva and dental plaque, but showed the presence of common inhabitants of modern oral cavities including Streptococcus sp., Veillonella dispar and Rothia mucilaginosa. Cell motility, signal transduction and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites may be unique features of the Saladoid microbiome. Discussion. Results suggest that the Saladoid dental calculi microbiome structure and function may possibly reflect a horticulturalist lifestyle and distinct dietary habits. Results also open the opportunity to further elucidate oral disease states in extinct Caribbean cultures and extinct indigenous cultures with similar lifestyles.","[Santiago-Rodriguez, Tasha M.; Cano, Raul J.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Applicat Biotechnol, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Santiago-Rodriguez, Tasha M.; Cano, Raul J.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Deparment, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Santiago-Rodriguez, Tasha M.; Cano, Raul J.] ATCC Ctr Translat Microbiol, Inst Life Sci Entrepreneurship, Union, NJ 07083 USA; [Narganes-Storde, Yvonne; Chanlatte-Baik, Luis] Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Archaeol Invest, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Toranzos, Gary A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute,"This work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute granted to TS-R through the Life Sciences Research Foundation.

Obesity is a major healthcare problem in both human and veterinary medicine and there is an increasing prevalence of obesity in people and pets. In people and animals, obesity is a complex disorder involving diet, level of physical activity, behavioural factors, socioeconomic factors, environment exposures, genetics, metabolism and the microbiome. Pets and people share a number of obesity-related comorbidities. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus in people and in cats, but this association is not recognized in dogs. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for a number of human cancers, but there are fewer data available describing this association with canine neoplastic disease. One approach to addressing the problem of obesity is by taking a 'One Health' perspective. Comparative clinical research examining shared lifestyle and environmental risk factors and the reasons underlying species differences should provide new perspectives on the fundamental biology of obesity. One Health programmes involving human healthcare professionals and veterinarians could help address obesity with simple interventions at the community level. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Given that the microbiome is related to both nutrient absorption, as well as overweight/obesity, it may play a central role in limiting or modifying normal growth processes while contributing to chronic disease risks. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe normal growth processes, the role of the microbiome in supporting or disrupting normal growth processes, and its potential impact on long-term health. Methods: A literature search of relevant human and laboratory research on growth, microbiome and the relationship between poor growth and chronic diseases was conducted. This review focuses on potential mechanisms that implicate the microbiome as a mediator of poor growth and later metabolic outcomes. In this relationship, attention was given to the potential for gastrointestinal infections to disrupt the microbiome. Results: Based on the studies reviewed, it is clear that exposure to infections disturbs both intestinal functioning as well as normal growth and changes in the microbiome may influence micronutrient availability and metabolic processes. Conclusions: The microbiome may play a significant role in limiting human growth, but little is known about changes in the microbiome during periods of undernutrition. Thus, it is of great scientific and public health importance to improve the understanding of how the microbiome changes during nutrient deprivation. To best address the issue of the double burden and poor growth in low-income countries, research is warranted to advance the knowledge of the long-term role of the microbiome in the health of children exposed to undernutrition.","[Hoffman, Daniel J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, 26 Nichol Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Hoffman, Daniel J.] Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Inst Food Nutr & Hlth, 26 Nichol Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Campos-Ponce, Maiza; Doak, Colleen M.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Hlth Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Taddei, Carla R.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Clin & Toxicol Anal, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Taddei, Carla R.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,,5,MAY,2017,44,3,10.1080/03014460.2016.1267261,"Anthropology; Biology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Recent studies indicate that immune activation may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. Numerous studies in animal models indicate that the mucosal microbiome may influence cognition and behavior by altering the functioning of the immune system. It is thus likely that the microbiome plays a role in human psychiatric disorders. The study of immune alterations and the microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is in its infancy. Two recent investigations of the oro-pharyngeal microbiota in schizophrenia found differences between cases and controls. Other studies have found increased gastrointestinal inflammation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder based on measures of microbial translocation. Several studies have also found an association between the receipt of antibiotics and an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to alterations in the microbiome. Studies to characterize the intestinal microbiome of individuals with these disorders are in progress. The ultimate test of the role of the microbiome and immune-mediated pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will come from clinical trials of therapeutic agents which alter gut microbiota or gastrointestinal inflammation. The successful development of such modalities would represent a novel strategy to prevent and treat serious psychiatric disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, in the last few decades, a focus on the development of novel stress-based paradigms and a focus on using hedonic/anhedonic behaviour have led to renewed optimism in the use of animal models to assess aspects of MDD. Therefore, in this review article, dedicated to Athina Markou, we summarise the use of stress-based animal models for studying MDD in rodents and how reward-related readouts can be used to validate/assess the model and/or treatment. We reveal the use and limitations of chronic stress paradigms, which we split into non-social (i.e. chronic mild stress), social (i.e. chronic social defeat) and drug-withdrawal paradigms for studying MDD and detail numerous reward-related readouts that are employed in preclinical research. Finally, we finish with a section regarding important factors to consider when using animal models. One of the most consistent findings following chronic stress exposure in rodents is a disruption of the brain reward system, which can be easily assessed using sucrose, social interaction, food, drug of abuse or intracranial self-stimulation as a readout. Probing the underlying causes of such alterations is providing a greater understanding of the potential systems and processes that are disrupted in MDD.","[Slattery, D.

The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. Results: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Conclusions: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS. These insights may enable more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform the development of specific therapeutic strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.","[Nagy-Szakal, Dorottya; Williams, Brent L.; Mishra, Nischay; Che, Xiaoyu; Lee, Bohyun; Jain, Komal; Eddy, Meredith L.; Hornig, Mady; Lipkin, W.

Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque (calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from El Sidron cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss reflected forest gathering(2,3). Differences in diet were also linked to an overall shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota. Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidron Neanderthal with a dental abscess(4) and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2x depth of coverage)-the oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.","[Weyrich, Laura S.; Soubrier, Julien; Arriola, Luis; Llamas, Bastien; Breen, James; Farrer, Andrew G.; Haak, Wolfgang; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Weyrich, Laura S.; Duchene, Sebastian; Soubrier, Julien; Arriola, Luis; Llamas, Bastien; Breen, James; Farrer, Andrew G.; Haak, Wolfgang; Holmes, Edward C.; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Duchene, Sebastian; Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Charles Perkins Ctr, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Duchene, Sebastian; Alt, Kurt W.; Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Morris, Alan G.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Human Biol, Cape Town, South Africa; [Alt, Kurt W.] Danube Private Univ, Krems, Austria; [Alt, Kurt W.; Dresely, Veit] State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, Saxony Anhalt, Germany; [Alt, Kurt W.; Dresely, Veit] Heritage Museum, Halle, Germany; [Alt, Kurt W.] Basel Univ, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, Basel, Switzerland; [Caramelli, David] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Florence, Italy; [Farrell, Milly] Oxford Brookes Univ, Human Origins & Palaeo Environm Grp, Oxford, England; [Francken, Michael; Harvati, Katerina] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Paleoanthropol, Tubingen, Germany; [Gully, Neville; Kaidonis, John; Townsend, Grant] Univ Adelaide, Sch Dent, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Hardy, Karen] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain; [Hardy, Karen] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Filosofia & Lletres, Dept Prehist, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Held, Petra] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, Mainz, Germany; [Lalueza-Fox, Carles] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Barcelona, Spain; [De la Rasilla, Marco] Univ Oviedo, Dept Hist, Area Prehist, Oviedo, Spain; [Rosas, Antonio] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Paleobiol, Paleoanthropol Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Semal, Patrick] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Sci Serv Heritage, Brussels, Belgium; [Soltysiak, Arkadiusz] Univ Warsaw, Inst Archaeol, Dept Bioarchaeol, Warsaw, Poland; [Usai, Donatella] Ist Italiano Africa & Oriente IsIAO, Rome, Italy; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, Esslingen, Germany; [Huson, Daniel H.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Algorithms Bioinformat, Tubingen, Germany; [Dobney, Keith] Univ Liverpool, Sch Hist Languages & Cultures, Dept Archaeol Class & Egyptol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Dobney, Keith] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Archaeol, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Dobney, Keith] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; ICREAICREA,"We thank G.

Each person is inhabited and also surrounded by his/her own signature microbial cloud. A low diversity of microorganisms is associated with a plethora of diseases, including allergy, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and even neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, an interaction of microorganisms with the host immune system is required for a healthy body. Exposure to microorganisms from themoment we are born and appropriate microbiome assembly during childhood are essential for establishing an active immune system necessary to prevent disease later in life. Exposure to microorganisms educates the immune system, induces adaptive immunity, and initiates memory B and T cells that are essential to combat various pathogens. The correct microbial-based education of immune cells may be critical in preventing the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer. This review provides a broad overview of the importance of the host microbiome and accumulating knowledge of how it regulates and maintains a healthy human system.

With estimates of hundreds of thousands of annual human deaths and a lack of new drugs to replace old ones, antimicrobial resistance probably constitutes one of the greatest human health and sustainability challenges of the 21st century. To safeguard treatable infections, a deliberate social-ecological transformation is needed toward stewardship of the global microbiome and long-term sustainable use of antibiotics. We review the foundation for such a transformation using recent insights from sustainability science, evolutionary biology and health, and the understanding of human interactions with microbes as two intertwined complex adaptive systems. A coherent strategy should acknowledge humans as the source of the world's strongest evolutionary force, reflect that antibiotics are building blocks of modern health systems, and strive to build social-ecological resilience to minimize levels of resistance and avoid over dependency on innovation of new drugs. Bottom up opportunities for seeding the transformation include participatory monitoring and stewardship of our personal and environmental microbiomes, as well as collective consumer action. Top down priorities include regular international institutions to coordinate multi-level action.","[Jorgensen, Peter Sogaard; Folke, Carl] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden; [Jorgensen, Peter Sogaard; Folke, Carl] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wernli, Didier] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Folke, Carl] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Carroll, Scott P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carroll, Scott P.] Inst Contemporary Evolut, Davis, CA USA; [Jorgensen, Peter Sogaard] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Box 50005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden","Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation [CF14-1050, CF15-0988]; Erling-Persson Family Foundation; Beijer Foundation","This manuscript benefited from comments from Otto Cars and Goran Tomson and discussions with Maja Schluter and other colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, as well as the SESYNC Living with Resistance working group led by PSJ and SPC.

High-throughput genome sequencing of microbial communities in the mammalian gastrointestinal system continues to present diverse protein function information to understand the bacterial determinants that influence obesity development. The goal of the research reported in this article was to identify biological processes in probiotic bacteria that could influence the mechanisms for the extraction of energy from diet in the human gastrointestinal system. Our research strategy of combining bioinformatics and visual analytics methods was based on the identification of operon gene arrangements in genomes of Lactobacillus species and Akkermansia muciniphila that include at least a gene for a universal stress protein. The two major findings from this research study are related to Lactobacillus plantarum and Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria species which are associated with weight-loss. The first finding is that Lactobacillus plantarum strains have a two-gene operon that encodes a universal stress protein for stress response and the membrane translocator protein (TSPO), known to function in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in humans. The second finding is the presence of a three-gene operon in Akkermansia muciniphila that includes a gene whose human mitochondrial homolog is associated with waist-hip ratio and fat distribution. From a public health perspective, elucidation of the bacterial determinants influencing obesity will help in educating the public on optimal probiotic use for anti-obesity effects.","[Isokpehi, Raphael D.] Bethune Cookman Univ, Coll Sci Engn & Math, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA; [Simmons, Shaneka S.] Jarvis Christian Coll, Div Arts & Sci, Hawkins, TX 75765 USA; [Simmons, Shaneka S.; Payton, Marinelle] Jackson State Univ, Ctr Excellence Minor Hlth & Hlth Dispar, Jackson, MS 39217 USA; [Johnson, Matilda O.] Bethune Cookman Univ, Petrock Coll Hlth Sci, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA","Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P20MD006899]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [HRD-1435186, OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM); Tuskegee University (TU); University of Alabama (UA); Creighton University (CU); Jackson State University (JSU); University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB); NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P20MD006899]","The research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Number P20MD006899.

Nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation are major contributors to impaired child neurodevelopment in these years, particularly in low-resource settings. This review identifies global research priorities relating to nutrition, infection, and inflammation in early to middle childhood neurodevelopment. The research priority areas identified include: (1) assessment of how nutrition, infection, or inflammation in the preconception, prenatal, and infancy periods (or interventions in these periods) affect function in early to middle childhood; (2) assessment of whether effects of nutritional interventions vary by poverty or inflammation; (3) determination of the feasibility of preschool-and school-based integrated nutritional interventions; (4) improved assessment of the epidemiology of infection-and inflammation-related neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI); (5) identification of mechanisms through which infection causes NDI; (6) identification of noninfectious causes of inflammation-related NDI and interventions for causes already identified (eg, environmental factors); and (7) studies on the effects of interactions between nutritional, infectious, and inflammatory factors on neurodevelopment in early to middle childhood. Areas of emerging importance that require additional study include the effects of maternal Zika virus infection, childhood environmental enteropathy, and alterations in the child's microbiome on neurodevelopment in early to middle childhood.

The recent commercialization of genome editing techniques makes the creation and release of genetically altered pathogens a much easier task, increasing the possibility to the point of needing discussion. Three areas need to be addressed: predictions concerning potential genetic alterations, predictions and implications concerning the release of genetically altered pathogens, and the short- and long-term implications of the release of genetically altered pathogens. Full discourse on these topics among professionals in the area of public health will help to combat harm from the use of any genetically altered biologic weapons. The topics covered here include a review of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique, including a discussion of which possibilities utilize genome editing. We then address predictions about the application of gene alterations in the context of bioweapons. We discuss a few basic concepts about the evolution of an intentionally released genetically altered organism based on circumstances and patterns gleaned from observing nature in the hope that this will aid in the public health response to bioterrorism attack.","[Pope, Samuel M.] Marian Univ, Coll Osteopath Med, Div Biomed Sci, 3200 Cold Spring Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46022 USA",,,1,APR,2017,11,2,10.1017/dmp.2016.123,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

These outcomes document age-related intestinal changes present in the absence of nutritional stressors, which are all known to affect gastrointestinal motility, microbiome, and MT. We found that old monkeys have greater systemic inflammation and poor intestinal barrier function as compared to young monkeys. Old monkeys have dramatically reduced intestinal motility, and all changes in motility and MT are present without large differences in fecal microbiomes. We conclude that deteriorating intestinal function is a feature of normal aging and could represent the source of inflammatory burden yet to be explained by disease or diet in normal aging human primate populations. Intestinal changes were seen independent of dietary influences and aging within a consistent environment appears to avoid major microbiome shifts. Our data suggests interventions to promote intestinal motility and mucosal barrier function have the potential to support better health with aging.","[Mitchell, E.

Recent advances in molecular techniques and informatics allow researchers to explore microbial composition in detail and to compare the structure of vaginal microbial communities with behavior and health outcomes, particularly acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and poor birth outcomes. Vaginal flora have been found to cluster into a limited number of communities, although community structure is dynamic. Certain community types are more associated with poor reproductive outcomes and STDs; communities dominated by Lactobacillus species, particularly Lactobacillus crispatus, are most associated with vaginal health. Modifiable and nonmodifiable factors are strongly associated with community composition, including behavior, race or ethnicity, and hygiene. In this review, we describe the state of the science on the vaginal microbiome and its relationship to behavior, sexual health, and STDs, including determinants of the microbiome that go beyond an individual level.","Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Sexually Transmitted Dis Prevent, Philadelphia, PA USA; Philadelphia Dept Publ Hlth, Philadelphia, PA USA",Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999],,18,APR,2017,129,4,10.1097/AOG.0000000000001932,Obstetrics & Gynecology

The vertical transmission of maternal microbes to the offspring is a critical factor for host immune and metabolic development. Increasing evidence also points to a role in the wiring of the gut-brain axis. This process may be altered by various factors such as mode of delivery, gestational age at birth, the use of antibiotics in early life, infant feeding, and hygiene practices.

However, the effect of dietary modification on specific gut metabolites, in association with immune, metabolic, and psychopathological functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorders has not been well characterized. The short chain fatty acids (SOFA) acetate, butyrate, and propionate, major metabolites derived from fermentation of dietary fibers by gut microbes, interact with multiple immune and metabolic pathways. The specific pathways that SOFA are thought to target, are dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and systemic inflammation. Most notably, these disorders are consistently linked to an attenuated lifespan in schizophrenia. Although, unhealthy dietary intake patterns and increased prevalence of immune and metabolic dysfunction has been observed in people with schizophrenia; dietary interventions have not been well utilized to target immune or metabolic illness. Prior schizophrenia patient trials primarily focused on the effects of gluten free diets. Findings from these studies indicate that a diet avoiding gluten benefits a limited subset of patients, individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Therefore, alternative dietary and nutritional modifications such as high-fiber, Mediterranean style, diets that enrich the production of SOFA, while being associated with a minimal likelihood of adverse events, may improve immune and cardiovascular outcomes linked to premature mortality in schizophrenia. With a growing literature demonstrating that SOFA can cross the blood brain barrier and target key inflammatory and metabolic pathways, this article highlights enriching dietary intake for SOFA as a potential adjunctive therapy for people with schizophrenia.","[Joseph, Jamie; Depp, Colin; Shih, Pei-an B.; Cadenhead, Kristen S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Depp, Colin] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA USA; [Schmid-Schonbein, Geert] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","UC San Diego Frontiers Innovation Scholars program [NIMH T32MH019934, NIMH T32MH018399, NIMH R01MH106781, NIMH100417]","This work was supported by the UC San Diego Frontiers Innovation Scholars program (PI: Depp, C.A.), NIMH T32MH019934 (PI: Jeste, D.V.), NIMH T32MH018399 (PI: Kelsoe, J.R.) to JJ, NIMH R01MH106781 to PS , and NIMH100417 to CD",13,Mar-27,2017,11,,10.3389/fnins.2017.00155,Neurosciences

This widely touted example of the mismatch between our biology and modern lifestyle has been intuited largely from the bioarchaeological record of the Neolithic Revolution in the New World. Recent studies of other populations have, however, challenged the universality of this assertion. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of oral health among a living population in transition from the bush to village life, the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that the shift from foraging to farming, or agricultural intensification, inevitably leads to increased periodontal disease, caries, and orthodontic disorders. Our results showed that women living in villages consuming a mostly agricultural diet exhibited more caries and periodontal disease than those living in the bush consuming a mostly wild-food diet. Furthermore, men living in the bush consuming mostly a wild-food diet had more than those living in the village consuming a mostly agricultural diet. These findings are explained by the high incidence of maize consumption in village settings, along with previously recognized variation in rate of caries between men and women. The unexpected discovery of high caries incidences for men in the bush is likely explained by heavy reliance on honey, and perhaps differential access to tobacco and marijuana. These data support the notions that mechanisms of cariogenesis are multifactorial and that the relationships between oral health and the shift from a predominantly wild-food diet to one dominated by cultigens are nuanced.","[Crittenden, Alyssa N.] Univ Nevada, Dept Anthropol, Metab Anthropometry & Nutr Lab, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Sorrentino, John] DMD Family & Cosmet Dent, New York, NY USA; [Moonie, Sheniz A.] Univ Nevada, Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Community Hlth Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Peterson, Mika] Dorobo Fund, Arusha, Tanzania; [Mabulla, Audax] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Archaeol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Ungar, Peter S.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Anthropol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1539843, 1539841]; University of Nevada, Las Vegas; D.M.D. Family and Cosmetic Dentistry","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant # 1539843 to ANC and # 1539841 to PSU) and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (Individual Investigator Award to ANC).

Mother's own milk (MOM) has been found to favorably alter gut microbiome composition in infants born at term. Evidence about the influence of feeding type on gut microbial colonization of preterm infants is limited. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of feeding types on gut microbial colonization of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: Thirty-three stable preterm infants were recruited at birth and followed up for the first 30 days of life. Daily feeding information was used to classify infants into six groups (MOM, human donor milk [HDM], Formula, MOM + HDM, MOM + Formula, and HDM + Formula) during postnatal days 0-10, 11-20, and 21-30. Stool samples were collected daily. DNA extracted from stool was used to sequence the 16S rRNA gene. Exploratory data analysis was conducted with a focus on temporal changes ofmicrobial patterns and diversities among infants from different feeding cohorts. Prediction of gut microbial diversity from feeding type was estimated using linear mixed models. Results: Preterm infants fed MOM (at least 70% of the total diet) had highest abundance of Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and Bacillales compared to infants in other feeding groups, whereas infants fed primarily HDM or formula had a high abundance of Enterobacteriales compared to infants fed MOM. After controlling for gender, postnatal age, weight, and birth gestational age, the diversity of gut microbiome increased over time and was constantly higher in infants fed MOM relative to infants with other feeding types (p <.01). Discussion: MOM benefits gut microbiome development of preterm infants, including balanced microbial community pattern and increased microbial diversity in early life.","[Cong, Xiaomei; Judge, Michelle; Xu, Wanli; Diallo, Ana] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, 231 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Cong, Xiaomei; Graf, Joerg] Univ Connecticut, Inst Syst Genom, Farmington, CT USA; [Cong, Xiaomei; Brownell, Elizabeth A.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Janton, Susan; Graf, Joerg] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Brownell, Elizabeth A.] Connecticut Childrens Med Ctr, Div Neonatol, Hartford, CT USA; [Maas, Kendra] Univ Connecticut, Microbial Anal Resources & Serv, Storrs, CT USA",National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR) [K23NR014674]; Affinity Research Collaboratives Award through University of Connecticut Institute for Systems Genomics,This publication was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-NINR) under Award K23NR014674 and Affinity Research Collaboratives Award through University of Connecticut Institute for Systems Genomics.,24,MAR-APR,2017,66,2,10.1097/NNR.0000000000000208,Nursing

Individual factors that modulate pulmonary aging include basic genetic configuration, environmental exposure, life-style and biography of systemic diseases. However, the actual aging of the lung takes place in pulmonary resident cells and is closely linked to aging of the immune system (immunosenescence). Therefore, this article reviews the current knowledge about the impact of aging on pulmonary cells and the immune system, without analyzing those factors that may accelerate the aging process in depth. Hallmarks of aging include alterations at molecular, cellular and cell-cell interaction levels. Because of the great variety of cell types in the lung, the consequences of aging display a broad spectrum of phenotypes. For example, aging is associated with more collagen and less elastin production by fibroblasts, thus increasing pulmonary stiffness and lowering compliance. Decreased sympathetic airway innervation may increase the constriction status of airway smooth muscle cells. Aging of resident and systemic immune cells leads to a pro-inflammatory milieu and reduced capacity of fighting infectious diseases. The current review provides an overview of cellular changes occurring with advancing age in general and in several cell types of the lung as well as of the immune system. Thereby, this survey not only aims at providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary aging but also to identify gaps in knowledge that warrant further investigations.","[Brandenberger, Christina; Muehlfeld, Christian] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Funct & Appl Anat, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Brandenberger, Christina; Muehlfeld, Christian] Cluster Excellence REBIRTH Regenerat Biol Reconst, Hannover, Germany; [Brandenberger, Christina; Muehlfeld, Christian] Biomed Res Endstage & Obstruct Lung Dis Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Brandenberger, Christina; Muehlfeld, Christian] German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Hannover, Germany",DFG via the Cluster of Excellence RebirthGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Hochschulinterne Leistungsforderung (HilF) of the Hannover Medical School; BMBF via the Deutsches Zentrum fur Lungenforderung (DZL)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"The authors' work is supported by DFG via the Cluster of Excellence Rebirth, BMBF via the Deutsches Zentrum fur Lungenforderung (DZL) and by the Hochschulinterne Leistungsforderung (HilF) of the Hannover Medical School.",27,MAR,2017,367,3,10.1007/s00441-016-2511-x,Cell Biology

However, mechanisms underlying its etiology and manifestations remain poorly understood. Although ASD is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of impaired social communication and repetitive behavior, immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal issues are common comorbidities. The microbiome is an integral part of human physiology; recent studies show that changes in the gut microbiota can modulate gastrointestinal physiology, immune function, and even behavior. Links between particular bacteria from the indigenous gut microbiota and phenotypes relevant to ASD raise the important question of whether microbial dysbiosis plays a role in the development or presentation of ASD symptoms. Here we review reports of microbial dysbiosis in ASD. We further discuss potential effects of the microbiota on ASDassociated symptoms, drawing on signaling mechanisms for reciprocal interactions among the microbiota, immunity, gut function, and behavior. In addition, we discuss recent findings supporting a role for the microbiome as an interface between environmental and genetic risk factors that are associated with ASD. These studies highlight the integration of pathways across multiple body systems that together can impact brain and behavior and suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disease.","[Vuong, Helen E.; Hsiao, Elaine Y.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Los Angeles, CA USA",UCLA's Department of Integrative Biology Physiology; National Institutes of Health Director's Early Independence Award [5DP5OD017924]; Alfred P.

Objectives: The objectives of this review are to (a) describe 16S rRNA sequencing and its role in answering research questions important to nursing science; (b) provide an overview of the oral, lung, and gut microbiomes and relevant research; and (c) identify future implications for microbiome research and 16S sequencing in translational nursing science. Discussion: Sequencing using the 16S rRNA gene has revolutionized research and allowed scientists to easily and reliably characterize complex bacterial communities. This type of research has recently entered the clinical setting, one of the best examples involving the use of 16S sequencing to identify resistant pathogens, thereby improving the accuracy of bacterial identification in infection control. Clinical microbiota research and related requisite methods are of particular relevance to nurse scientists-individuals uniquely positioned to utilize these techniques in future studies in clinical settings.","[Ames, Nancy J.; Ranucci, Alexandra; Wallen, Gwenyth R.] NIH, Dept Nursing, Ctr Clin, Bldg 10,Room 2B10,10 Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ranucci, Alexandra] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Moriyama, Brad] NIH, Dept Pharm, Ctr Clin, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Clinical Center Nursing Department, National Institutes for Health","The authors acknowledge that this work was supported by the Clinical Center Nursing Department, National Institutes for Health.",4,MAR-APR,2017,66,2,10.1097/NNR.0000000000000212,Nursing

Currently, most antidepressants work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the brain to improve these symptoms. However, in the last decade, research has revealed an extensive bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, referred to as the ""gut-brain axis."" Advances in this field have linked psychiatric disorders to changes in the microbiome, making it a potential target for novel antidepressant treatments. The aim of this review is to analyze the current body of research assessing the effects of probiotics, on symptoms of depression in humans. Methods: A systematic search of five databases was performed and study selection was completed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses process. Results: Ten studies met criteria and were analyzed for effects on mood, anxiety, and cognition. Five studies assessed mood symptoms, seven studies assessed anxiety symptoms, and three studies assessed cognition. The majority of the studies found positive results on all measures of depressive symptoms; however, the strain of probiotic, the dosing, and duration of treatment varied widely and no studies assessed sleep. Conclusion: The evidence for probiotics alleviating depressive symptoms is compelling but additional double-blind randomized control trials in clinical populations are warranted to further assess efficacy.","[Wallace, Caroline J.

Recently, a strong association was found between impulsivity and obesity which may explain the high prevalence of metabolic disorders in individuals with mental illness even in the absence of exposure to psychotropic drugs. As the overlapping neurobiology of impulsivity and obesity is being unraveled, the question asked louder and louder is whether they should be treated concomitantly. The treatment of obesity and metabolic dysregulations in chronic psychiatric patients is currently underutilized and often initiated late, making correction more difficult to achieve. Addressing obesity and metabolic dysfunction in a preventive manner may not only lower morbidity and mortality but also the excessive impulsivity, decreasing the risk for aggression.

Critical periods of neurodevelopment are windows of opportunity in which the neuronal circuits are extremely plastic and can be easily subjected to remodeling in response to experience. However, the brain is also more susceptible to aberrant stimuli that might lead to altered developmental trajectories. Intriguingly, postnatal brain development is paralleled by the maturation of the gut microbiota: the ecosystem of symbionts populating our gastro-intestinal tract. Recent discoveries have started to unveil an unexpected link between the gut microbiome and neurophysiological processes. Indeed, the commensal bacteria seem to be able to influence host behavioral outcome and neurochemistry through mechanisms which remain poorly understood. Remarkably, the efficacy of the gut flora action appears to be dependent on the timing during postnatal life at which the host gut microbes' signals reaches the brain, suggesting the fascinating possibility of critical periods for this microbiota-driven shaping of host neuronal functions and behavior. Therefore, to understand the importance of the intestinal ecosystem's impact on neuronal circuits functions and plasticity during development and the discovery of the involved molecular mechanisms, will pave the way to identify new and, hopefully, powerful microbiota-based therapeutic interventions for the treatment of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases.","[Tognini, Paola] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Epigenet & Metab, Dept Biol Chem, Sassone Corsi Lab, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [LT-000576/2013],"The author thanks Dr. Karen Lindsay (University of California, Irvine, CA, USA) for critical reading and editing of the manuscript and the two anonymous reviewers for their help.

Neuman at the Research Society on Alcoholism Annual Meeting, on June 25, 2016 at New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The integrative symposium investigated different aspects of alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) as well as non alcohol -induced liver disease (NAFLD) and possible repair. We revealed the basic aspects of alcohol metabolism that may be responsible for the development of liver disease as well as the factors that determine the amount, frequency and which type of alcohol misuse leads to liver and gastrointestinal diseases. We aimed to (1) describe the immuno-pathology of ALD, (2) examine the role of genetics in the development of alcoholic hepatitis (ASH) and NAFLD, (3) propose diagnostic markers of ASH and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), (4) examine age and ethnic differences as well as analyze the validity of some models, (5) develop common research tools and biomarkers to study alcohol-induced effects, 6) examine the role of alcohol in oral health and colon and gastrointestinal cancer and (7) focus on factors that aggravate the severity of organ-damage. The present review includes pre-clinical, translational and clinical research that characterizes ALD and NAFLD. Strong clinical and experimental evidence lead to recognition of the key toxic role of alcohol in the pathogenesis of ALD with simple fatty infiltrations and chronic alcoholic hepatitis with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. These latter stages may also be associated with a number of cellular and histological changes, including the presence of Mallory's hyaline, megamitochondria, or perivenular.and perisinusoidal fibrosis. Genetic polymorphisms of ethanol metabolizing enzymes and cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2E1 activation may change the severity of ASH and NASH. Other risk factors such as its co-morbidities with chronic viral hepatitis in the presence or absence of human deficiency virus were discussed. Dysregulation of metabolism, as a result of ethanol exposure, in the intestine leads to colon carcinogenesis. The hepatotoxic effects of ethanol undermine the contribution of malnutrition to the liver injury. Dietary interventions such as micro and macronutrients, as well as changes to the microbiota have been suggested. The clinical aspects of NASH, as part of the metabolic syndrome in the aging population, have been presented. The symposium addressed mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol induced damage to different organs, as well as the role of the microbiome in this dialog. The microbiota regulates and acts as a key element in harmonizing immune responses at intestinal mucosal surfaces. It is known that microbiota is an inducer of proinflammatory T helper 17 cells and regulatory T cells in the intestine. The signals at the sites of inflammation mediate recruitment and differentiation in order to remove inflammatory inducers and promote tissue homeostasis restoration. The change in the intestinal microbiota also influences the change in obesity and regresses the liver steatosis. Evidence on the positive role of moderate alcohol consumption on heart and metabolic diseases as well on reducing steatosis have been looked up. Moreover nutrition as a therapeutic intervention in alcoholic liver disease has been discussed. In addition to the original data, we searched the literature (2008-2016) for the latest publication on the described subjects. In order to obtain the updated data we used the usual engines (Pub Med and Google Scholar). The intention of the eighth symposia was to advance the international profile of the biological research on alcoholism. We also wish to further our mission of leading the forum to progress the science and practice of translational research in alcoholism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

NCAA Division III athletes participate in athletics at a level of intensity that is more moderate compared to other NCAA divisions. Alterations in the microbiome have been associated with alterations in psychosocial well-being and with exercise. Therefore, we also proposed that the oral microbiota Would be different in ""in-season"" versus ""off-season"" athletes. Method: In this pilot study, nineteen female students participating on a NCAA Division III athletic team (hockey = ""in-season""; soccer = ""off-season"") were compared for level of fitness (modified Balke test of VO2 max), salivary IgA levels by immunoassay, anxiety (using a GAD-7 survey), salivary cortisol levels by immunoassay, and numbers of culturable bacteria by growth of CFU/ml on blood agar, mitis salivarius agar and Staphylococcus 110 agar. Results: The proportion of subjects reporting ""severe anxiety"" on an anxiety scale (GAD-7) were significantly greater in the ""off-season"" group compared to the ""in-season"" group (p = 0.047, Chi-squared test). ""In-season"" athletes had significantly higher salivary IgA/total protein levels than ""off-season"" athletes (one-sided Student's t-test; p = 0.03). Cortisol levels were not significantly different in the two groups. The total culturable bacteria counts were higher among ""in-season"" athletes (p = 0.0455, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test), as measured by CFUs on blood agar plates, an estimate of total culturable bacteria, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. In contrast, there was a decrease in the growth of bacteria from the oral cavity of the ""in-season"" athletes, When the growth of bacteria on mitis salivarius agar (primarily oral streptococcus) was measured (p = 0.0006, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). There was a negative correlation (Spearman Rank correlation coefficient = -0.651, p = 0.0018 one-sided) between high IgA levels and the growth of bacteria on mitis salivarius agar in the combined group of ""in-season"" and ""off-season"" athletes, suggesting a protective response of high IgA levels to the typical oral pathogenic bacteria. Anxiety levels (GAD-7) in the ""in-season"" group were positively correlated with growth of oral bacteria on blood agar (Spearman Rank correlation coefficient of 0.622 for ""in-season"", p value = 0.033 one-sided) and mitis salivarius agar (Spearman Rank correlation coefficient = 0.671 for ""in-season, p value = 0.021 one-sided), and negatively correlated in ""off-season"" athletes on blood agar (-0.689 for ""off-season"", p value = 0.028 one-sided), supporting the hypothesis that the microbiota are distinct in ""in season"" and ""off-season"" athletes and may be associated with anxiety levels. Conclusion: These findings are supportive of the hypothesis that participation in college level athletics has a positive effect on student-athlete health, specifically enhanced protective oral immunity, reduced anxiety, and alterations in oral microbial populations.

Gut dysbiosis has been linked to a wide range of physical and psychological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and anxiety, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. A wealth of information on the effects of dysbiosis on anxiety and depression has been reported in laboratory model systems (e.g., germ-free mice); however, the effects of microbiome disruption on social behaviors (e.g., aggression) of non model species that may be particularly important in understanding many aspects of physiology and behavior have yet to be fully explored. Here we assessed the sex-specific effects of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on the gut microbiome and its effects on social behaviors in male and female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). In Experiment 1, we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic on a short-term basis and found that antibiotic treatment altered the microbial communities in the gut in male and female hamsters. In Experiment 2, we tested the effects of single versus repeated antibiotic treatment (including a recovery phase) on behavior, and found that two, but not one, treatments caused marked decreases in aggressive behavior, but not other social behaviors, in males; aggression returned to normal levels following recovery. Antibiotic-treated females, in contrast, showed decreased aggression after a single treatment, with all other social behaviors unaffected. Unlike males, female aggression did not return to normal during either recovery period. The present findings demonstrate that modest antibiotic treatment results in marked disruption of the gut microbiome in hamsters, akin to research done in other rodent species and humans. Further, we show that treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which has dysbiotic effects, also has robust, sex-specific effects on aggression, a critical behavior in the survival and reproductive success of many rodent species.

Method: We identified all individuals born in Denmark 1985-2002 (N = 1 015 447) and studied the association between infections treated with anti-infective agents and the subsequent risk of schizophrenia and affective disorders during 1995-2013. Cox regression analyses were adjusted for important confounders. Results: Infections treated with anti-infective agents were associated with increased risks of schizophrenia by a hazard rate ratio (HRR) of 1.37 (95%-CI = 1.20-1.57) and affective disorders by a HRR of 1.64 (95%-CI = 1.48-1.82), fitting a dose-response and temporal relationship (P < 0.001). The excess risk was primarily driven by infections treated with antibiotics, whereas infections treated with antivirals, antimycotics, and antiparasitic agents were not significant after mutual adjustment. Individuals with infections requiring hospitalization had the highest risks for schizophrenia (HRR = 2.05; 95%-CI = 1.77-2.38) and affective disorders (HRR = 2.59; 95%-CI = 2.31-2.89). Conclusion: Infections treated with anti-infective agents and particularly infections requiring hospitalizations were associated with increased risks of schizophrenia and affective disorders, which may be mediated by effects of infections/inflammation on the brain, alterations of the microbiome, genetics, or other environmental factors.","[Kohler, O.; Mors, O.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Psychosis Res Unit, Skovagervej 2, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark; [Kohler, O.; Petersen, L.; Mors, O.; Mortensen, P.

In this article, we review studies examining the relationship between intestinal bacteria and ASD, and discuss bacterial species that may be implicated and proposed mechanisms.","[Ding, Helen T.; Walkup, John T.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ding, Helen T.; Walkup, John T.] New York Presbyterian Hosp, 21 Bloomingdale Rd, White Plains, NY 10605 USA; [Taur, Ying] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Infect Dis, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Taur, Ying] Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY USA",Eli LillyEli Lilly; PfizerPfizer; AbbottAbbott Laboratories; Shire; Tourette Syndrome-Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Hartwell Foundation; Tourette Syndrome Association,"Dr. Ding declares that she has no conflict of interest.

Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences cognitive function via the gut-brain axis, and that WD factors significantly alter the proportions of commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review mechanisms through which consuming a WD negatively impacts neurocognitive function, with a particular focus on recent evidence linking the gut microbiome with dietary- and metabolic-associated hippocampal impairment. We highlight evidence linking gut bacteria to altered intestinal permeability and blood brain barrier integrity, thus making the brain more vulnerable to the influx of deleterious substances from the circulation. WD consumption also increases production of endotoxin by commensal bacteria, which may promote neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Recent findings also show that diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota impair peripheral insulin sensitivity, which is associated with hippocampal neuronal derrangements and associated mnemonic deficits. In some cases treatment with specific probiotics or prebiotics can prevent or reverse some of the deleterious impact of WD consumption on neuropsychological outcomes, indicating that targeting the microbiome may be a successful strategy for combating dietary- and metabolic-associated cognitive impairment.","[Noble, Emily E.; Hsu, Ted M.; Kanoski, Scott E.] Univ Southern Calif, Human & Evolutionary Biol Sect, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Hsu, Ted M.; Kanoski, Scott E.] Univ Southern Calif, Neurosci Program, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [DK104897]; University of Southern California Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute,This work was supported by grant number DK104897 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and also by the University of Southern California Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute (Awarded to SK).,44,Jan-30,2017,11,,10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00009,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences

The causes of these disorders remain poorly understood, but gut microbiota, the 1013 bacteria in the human intestines, have been implicated because children with ASD often suffer gastrointestinal (GI) problems that correlate with ASD severity. Several previous studies have reported abnormal gut bacteria in children with ASD. The gut microbiome-ASD connection has been tested in a mouse model of ASD, where the microbiome was mechanistically linked to abnormal metabolites and behavior. Similarly, a study of children with ASD found that oral non-absorbable antibiotic treatment improved GI and ASD symptoms, albeit temporarily. Here, a small open-label clinical trial evaluated the impact of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) on gut microbiota composition and GI and ASD symptoms of 18 ASD-diagnosed children. Results: MTT involved a 2-week antibiotic treatment, a bowel cleanse, and then an extended fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) using a high initial dose followed by daily and lower maintenance doses for 7-8 weeks. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale revealed an approximately 80% reduction of GI symptoms at the end of treatment, including significant improvements in symptoms of constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. Improvements persisted 8 weeks after treatment. Similarly, clinical assessments showed that behavioral ASD symptoms improved significantly and remained improved 8 weeks after treatment ended. Bacterial and phagedeep sequencing analyses revealed successful partial engraftment of donor microbiota and beneficial changes in the gut environment. Specifically, overall bacterial diversity and the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Desulfovibrio among other taxa increased following MTT, and these changes persisted after treatment stopped (followed for 8 weeks). Conclusions: This exploratory, extended-duration treatment protocol thus appears to be a promising approach to alter the gut microbiome and virome and improve GI and behavioral symptoms of ASD. Improvements in GI symptoms, ASD symptoms, and the microbiome all persisted for at least 8 weeks after treatment ended, suggesting a long-term impact.","[Kang, Dae-Wook; Maldonado, Juan; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Swette Ctr Environm Biotechnol, Tempe, AZ 85721 USA; [Adams, James B.; Geis, Elizabeth; Pollard, Elena L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gregory, Ann C.; Sullivan, Matthew B.] Univ Arizona, Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Borody, Thomas] Ctr Digest Dis, Five Dock, NSW 2046, Australia; [Chittick, Lauren; Roux, Simon; Sullivan, Matthew B.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85287 USA; [Fasano, Alessio] Massachusetts Gen Hosp Children, Mucosal Immunol & Biol Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Khoruts, Alexander] Univ Minnesota, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Med, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Khoruts, Alexander; Sadowsky, Michael J.] Univ Minnesota, BioTechnol Inst, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Khoruts, Alexander] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Immunol, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [McDonough-Means, Sharon] Integrat Dev Pediat, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA; [Sadowsky, Michael J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Lipson, Karen Schwarzberg; Caporaso, J.

While the focus has been on human genomic research, rapid advances in human microbiome research further complicate the debate. Discussion: We draw on two cystic fibrosis biobanks in Toronto, Canada, to illustrate our points. The biobanks have been established to facilitate sample and data sharing for research into the link between disease progression and microbial dynamics in the lungs of pediatric and adult patients. We begin by providing an overview of some of the ELSI associated with human microbiome research, particularly on the implications for the broader society. We then discuss ethical considerations regarding the identifiability of samples biobanked for human microbiome research, and examine the issue of return of results and incidental findings. We argue that, for the purposes of research ethics oversight, human microbiome research samples should be treated with the same privacy considerations as human tissues samples. We also suggest that returning individual microbiome-related findings could provide a powerful clinical tool for care management, but highlight the need for a more grounded understanding of contextual factors that may be unique to human microbiome research. Conclusions: We revisit the ELSI of biobanking and consider the impact that human microbiome research might have. Our discussion focuses on identifiability of human microbiome research samples, and return of research results and incidental findings for clinical management.","[Chuong, Kim H.; O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hwang, David M.; Yau, Yvonne C.

One of the most important achievements of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is to produce millions of sequence reads in a short period of time, and to produce large sequences of DNA in fragments of any size. Libraries can be generated from whole genomes or any DNA or RNA region of interest without the need to know its sequence beforehand. This allows for looking for variations and facilitating genetic identification. Objectives: A deep analysis of current NGS technologies and their application, especially in forensics, including a discussion about the pros and cons of these technologies in genetic identification. Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus electronic databases was performed for the period of December 2012 to June 2015. Results: In the forensic field, one of the main problems is the limited amount of sample available, as well as its degraded state. If the amount of DNA input required for preparing NGS libraries continues to decrease, nearly any sample could be sequenced; therefore, the maximum information from any biological remains could be obtained. Additionally, microbiome typification could be an interesting application to study for crime scene characterisation. Conclusions: NGS technologies are going to be crucial for DNA human typing in cases like mass disasters or other events where forensic specimens and samples are compromised and degraded. With the use of NGS it will be possible to achieve the simultaneous analysis of the standard autosomal DNA (STRs and SNPs), mitochondrial DNA, and X and Y chromosomal markers.","[Jesus Alvarez-Cubero, Maria; Martinez-Garcia, Belen; Antonio Lorente, Jose; Javier Martinez-Gonzalez, Luis] Univ Granada, Ctr Pfizer, Junta Andalucia Genom & Invest Oncol, Parque Tecnol Ciencias Salud PTS,GENYO, Granada, Spain; [Saiz, Maria; Antonio Lorente, Jose] Univ Granada, Fac Med, Dept Med Legal Toxicol & Antropol Fis, Lab Identificac Genet, Granada, Spain; [Sayalero, Sara M.] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, CRAG Ctr Recerca Agrigenom, Barcelona, Spain; [Entrala, Carmen] BIC, Ciencias Salud, LORGEN GP, PT, Granada, Spain",,,6,,2017,44,7,10.1080/03014460.2017.1375155,"Anthropology; Biology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The gut microbiota is implicated in gastrointestinal health, nutrient metabolism and benefits such as prevention of infection. Dietary fiber, including prebiotics, escape digestion in the small intestine and reach the colon intact, where they are partially or completely fermented by the gut microbiota.Areas covered: The possible interactions between dietary fiber, prebiotics and microbiota are discussed as well as how this relates to functional gastrointestinal disorders. During the first years of life the microbiota have not yet reached a stable state and is sensitive to disturbance by environmental factors. An imbalance in the microbiota early in life is found to be associated with several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as colic, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.Expert commentary: A better understanding of how gut microbial changes in early-life can impact gastrointestinal health might lead to new treatments or disease prevention. Nutritional strategies with fiber or prebiotics may support health due to modification of colonic microbiota composition and metabolic activity, for example by growth stimulation of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.","[Wegh, Carrie A.

Dysbiosis of the microbiome may result in altered neurodevelopment; however, it is unclear which specific members of microbiota are most influential and what factors might mediate the relationship between the gut and the brain. Twenty-four vaginally-derived male piglets were subjected to magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 30 d of age. Ascending colon contents, feces, and blood were collected and analyzed for volatile fatty acids, microbiota relative abundance by 16s rRNA, and serum metabolites, respectively. A mediation analysis was performed to assess the mediatory effect of serum biomarkers on the relationship between microbiota and neurometabolites. Results indicated fecal Ruminococcus and Butyricimonas predicted brain N-acetylaspartate (NM). Analysis of serum biomarkers indicated Ruminococcus independently predicted serum serotonin and cortisol. A 3-step mediation indicated: i) Ruminococcus negatively predicted NM, ii) Ruminococcus negatively predicted cortisol, and iii) a significant indirect effect (Le, the effect of fecal Ruminococcus through cortisol on NM) was observed and the direct effect became insignificant. Thus, serum cortisol fully mediated the relationship between fecal Ruminococcus and brain NAA. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this study used a statistical mediation analysis and provides a novel perspective into the potential underlying mechanisms through which the microbiota may shape brain development. This is the first study to link Ruminococcus, cortisol, and NAA in vivo, and these findings are substantiated by previous literature indicating these factors may be influential in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.","[Mudd, Austin T.; Dilger, Ryan N.] Univ Illinois, Piglet Nutr & Cognit Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mudd, Austin T.; Dilger, Ryan N.] Univ Illinois, Neurosci Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Berding, Kirsten; Donovan, Sharon M.; Dilger, Ryan N.] Univ Illinois, Div Nutr Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Wang, Mei; Donovan, Sharon M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Mead Johnson Nutrition (Evansville, IN); Mead Johnson Nutrition","This project was funded by Mead Johnson Nutrition (Evansville, IN).

The microbiome, intestinal compositional changes, and resultant bacterial translocation add a new element to the bidirectional interactions of the gut -brain axis; new evidence implicates these pathways in the patho-aetiology of MDD. In addition, abnormalities in the gut-brain axis are associated with several chronic non-communicable disorders, which frequently co-occur in individuals with MDD, including but not limited to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database up until May 1, 2016 for studies which investigated intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation (the 'leaky gut') in the pathophysiology of MDD and co-occurring somatic comorbidities with an emphasis on IBS, CFS, obesity, and T2DM. Results: The composition of the gut microbiota is influenced by several genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet). Several lines of evidence indicate that gut-microbiotadiet interactions play a significant pathophysiological role in MDD and related medical comorbidities. Gut dysbiosis and the leaky gut may influence several pathways implicated in the biology of MDD, including but not limited to immune activation, O&NS, and neuroplasticity cascades. However, methodological inconsistencies and limitations limit comparisons across studies. Conclusions: Intestinal dysbiosis and the leaky gut may constitute a key pathophysiological link between MDD and its medical comorbidities. This emerging literature opens relevant preventative and therapeutic perspectives. (C) 2016 S.

The bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, occurs through various pathways including the vagus nerve, the immune system, neuroendocrine pathways, and bacteria-derived metabolites. This axis has been shown to influence neurotransmission and the behavior that are often associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. Therefore, research targeting the modulation of this gut microbiota as a novel therapy for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions is gaining interest. Numerous factors have been highlighted to influence gut microbiota composition, including genetics, health status, mode of birth, and environment. However, it is diet composition and nutritional status that has repeatedly been shown to be one of the most critical modifiable factors regulating the gut microbiota at different time points across the lifespan and under various health conditions. Thus the microbiota is poised to play a key role in nutritional interventions for maintaining brain health.","Univ Coll Cork, APC Microbiome Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Cryan, John F.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Western Gateway Bldg, Cork, Ireland; Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat Neurobehav Sci, Cork, Ireland; Teagasc Moorepk Food Res Ctr, Fermoy, Cork, Ireland","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland [07/CE/B1368, 12/RC/2273]; Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine [DAFM 14/F821]; Enterprise Ireland","The authors are supported in part by the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) (Grant Numbers 07/CE/B1368 and 12/RC/2273); the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Grant Number DAFM 14/F821); and Enterprise Ireland.",77,JAN,2017,179,,10.1016/j.trsl.2016.10.002,"Medical Laboratory Technology; Medicine, General & Internal; Medicine, Research & Experimental"

Recently, extensive use of antibiotics has led to alterations of the gut microbiome, predisposition to various diseases and most importantly, increase in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which poses a major threat to global public health. Another major issue faced worldwide due to unregulated use of antibiotics in children as well as in adults is the influence of metabolism and body weight homeostasis, leading to obesity. Apart from the involvement of biosocial causes influencing diet, physical activity, and antibiotic use, pathogenesis of obesity is linked to interconnected functional alterations in cells, tissues and organs due to biochemical, epigenetic and genetic factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one such factor, which is becoming the primary focus of various aspects of research on multifactorial complex diseases and is providing new perspectives on etiology, biomarker-based diagnosis, and drug sensitivity Through this review, we have made an attempt to present the interplay between use of antibiotics, obesity, and associated mitochondrial dysfunction. This may provide insights into the molecular basis, genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, which in turn may have potential clinical applications in the management of antibiotic use.

This review presents the current knowledge on the pathways through which MPS may affect the fetus, and the existing evidence regarding the association between MPS and development of allergy in the offspring. Result and Discussion: A pivotal mediator triggered in response to stress is the release of glucocorticoids (GC). GC may affect gene expression through binding to GC receptors, thus affecting fetal development in general, and allergic vulnerability in particular. A series of recent findings also indicate that MPS may affect the fetus programming of immune functions and lead to vulnerability of the immune system. MPS may hinder the gradual process in the offspring's cytokine production towards a Th1 type immune response. Prenatal factors may also influence the intrauterine microbiome and thereby the maternal bacteria transferred into the fetal gastrointestinal tract. The imbalances of intestinal microbiota in infancy could result in deviations in the development of systemic immune function, predisposing to allergic sensitization. Epidemiological studies in humans also suggest that there is an association of MPS and allergic vulnerability of the offspring. Conclusion: Although the existing evidence support a relationship of MPS with allergic predisposition of the offspring, further studies are needed to elucidate whether the association is dependent on the type of stress and whether it involves any type of allergic predisposition or not.","[Moustaki, Maria; Priftis, Kostas N.; Douros, Konstantinos] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Attikon Hosp, Pediat Allergy & Resp Unit,Dept Pediat 3, 1 Rimini Str, Athens 12464, Greece; [Tsabouri, Sophia] Univ Ioannina, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Child Hlth Dept, Ioannina, Greece",,,0,,2017,17,4,10.2174/1871530317666170912160646,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Scientific advances in the knowledge of the human ""superorganism"" (hybrid consortium of human plus microbial communities that cooperatively regulates health and disease) enable the design of definitive studies to estimate the pathogen doses overcome by the innate defenses, including the protective microbiota. The systematic investigation of the events of non-typhoid salmonellosis in humans undertaken nearly 2 decades ago was updated to incorporate recent scientific advances in the understanding of impact of the healthy superorganism that strengthens and extends the biological motivations for sublinear or convex dose-response curves in microbial risk assessment. The knowledge of colonization resistance (innate protection of the human superorganism from low doses of ingested pathogens) and microbiota-mediated clearance is advancing mechanistically for many pathosystems.

Recent work has highlighted how immune-inflammatory processes and their interactions with oxidative and nitrosative stress, couple to drive changes in neuroregulatory tryptophan catabolites, with consequences for serotonin availability, including as a precursor for the melatonergic pathways. Subsequent alterations in the regulation of local melatonin synthesis are likely to have direct impacts on the reactivity of immune cells, both centrally and systemically. These inflammatory processes also lead to the activation of wider immune processes. Such wider processes can include the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibody responses, including to tryptophan catabolites, emphasizing the importance of immune responses, and their interactions with inflammatory processes, in the etiology and course of an array of medical conditions, including CNS disorders and psychiatric conditions. Such work poses questions as to the validity and utility of current, non-biologically based classification systems for psychiatric and CNS disorders. In this article, the biological underpinnings of CNS disorders and psychiatric conditions are reviewed in the context of how recent data, in reconceptualizing key processes in these classically-conceived brain-associated disorders, provides scope for novel, and hopefully more clinically useful, treatments. These processes are looked at in detail in Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. One important treatment target is the gut. Alterations in the gut, including gut permeability and the composition of the microbiome, have now become an important target for treatment across an array of medical conditions, emphasizing the importance of targeting regulators of the immune system in developing novel treatments that are based on a more comprehensive and wholistic' understanding of currently poorly managed medical conditions, particularly psychiatric and CNS disorders.","[Anderson, George] CRC Scotland & London, Eccleston Sq, London, England; [Maes, Michael] Deakin Univ, Dept Psychiat, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Maes, Michael] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Maes, Michael] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Londrina, Brazil; [Maes, Michael] Revitalis, Waalre, Netherlands; [Maes, Michael] Med Univ Plovdiv, Dept Psychiat, Plovdiv, Bulgaria",,,11,,2017,16,3,10.2174/1871527315666161122144659,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

These features, established largely in rodent studies, have informed hypotheses about the role of microbiota in human psychiatric disorders. Microbiota affect phenomena that are known to be parts of the depression phenotype, such as exaggerated response to stress and inflammatory features. Furthermore, the role of microbiota in neurodevelopment and in the modulation of social behavior suggests the possibility of its role in autism spectrum disorder and in schizophrenia. If altered, microbiota play a role in psychiatric disorders, then efforts to normalize the gut microbial population by the ingestion of probiotics (live bacteria) could have antidepresssant or antipsychotic effects.

As such, scholars from a wide range of fields have taken great interest in the role that subsistence has played in both human cultural and biological evolution. Central to this discussion is the diet composition and nutrition of contemporary hunters and gatherers, who are frequently conscripted as model populations for ancestral human nutrition. Research among the world's few remaining foraging populations is experiencing a resurgence, as they are making the final transition away from diets composed of wild foods, to those dominated by domesticated cultigens and/or processed foods. In an effort to glean as much information as possible, before such populations are no longer hunting and gathering, researchers interested in the evolution of human nutrition are rapidly collecting and accessing new and more data. Methods of scientific inquiry are in the midst of rapid change and scholars are able to revisit long-standing questions using state of the art analyses. Here, using the most relevant findings from studies in ethnography, nutrition, human physiology, and microbiomes, we provide a brief summary of the study of the evolution of human nutrition as it has specifically pertained to data coming from living hunter-gatherers.

The taxonomic makeup of a holobiont's microbial community may vary over its lifetime and differ from that of conspecifics. In contrast, biochemical functions of the microbiota and contributions to host biology are more conserved, with taxonomically variable but functionally similar microbes recurring across generations and hosts. To save what is of interest in holobiont thinking, we propose casting metabolic and developmental interaction patterns, rather than the taxa responsible for them, as units of selection. Such units need not directly reproduce or form parent-offspring lineages: their prior existence has created the conditions under which taxa with the genes necessary to carry out their steps have evolved in large numbers. These taxa or genes will reconstruct the original interaction patterns when favorable conditions occur. Interaction patterns will vary (for instance by the alteration or addition of intermediates) in ways that affect the likelihood of and circumstances under which such reconstruction occurs. Thus, they vary in fitness, and evolution by natural selection will occur at this level. It is on the persistence, reconstruction, and spread of such interaction patterns that students of holobiosis should concentrate, we suggest. This model also addresses other multi-species collectively beneficial interactions, such as biofilms or biogeochemical cycles maintaining all life.","[Doolittle, W.

FSS are prevalent in all medical settings and can be defined as syndromes that, after appropriate medical assessment, cannot be explained in terms of a conventional medical or surgical disease. FSS are frequent and the clinical importance varies from vague symptoms to extreme disability. No well-described medical explanations exist for FSS, and how to delimit FSS remains a controversial topic. The specific aims with the cohort were to test delimitations of FSS, estimate prevalence and incidence rates, identify risk factors, delimitate the pathogenic pathways, and explore the consequences of FSS. The study population comprises a random sample of 9,656 men and women aged 18-76 years from the general population examined from 2011 to 2015. The survey comprises screening questionnaires for five types of FSS, ie, fibromyalgia, whiplash-associated disorder, multiple chemical sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome, and for the unifying diagnostic category of bodily distress syndrome. Additional data included a telephone-based diagnostic interview assessment for FSS, questionnaires on physical and mental health, personality traits, lifestyle, use of health care services and social factors, and a physical examination with measures of cardiorespiratory and morphological fitness, metabolic fitness, neck mobility, heart rate variability, and pain sensitivity.

Observational studies provide evidence for effects of maternal obesity on her off spring's risks of obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. Maternal obesity could also lead to poorer cognitive performance and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including cerebral palsy. Preliminary evidence suggests potential implications for immune and infectious-disease-related outcomes. Insights from experimental studies support causal effects of maternal obesity on off spring outcomes, which are mediated at least partly through changes in epigenetic processes, such as alterations in DNA methylation, and perhaps through alterations in the gut microbiome. Although the off spring of obese women who lose weight before pregnancy have a reduced risk of obesity, few controlled intervention studies have been done in which maternal obesity is reversed and the consequences for off spring have been examined. Because the long-term effects of maternal obesity could have profound public health implications, there is an urgent need for studies on causality, underlying mechanisms, and effective interventions to reverse the epidemic of obesity in women of childbearing age and to mitigate consequences for off spring.","[Godfrey, Keith M.] Univ Southampton, MRC Lifecourse Epidemiol Unit, Southampton, Hants, England; [Godfrey, Keith M.] Univ Southampton, NIHR Southampton Biomed Res Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Godfrey, Keith M.] Southampton NHS Fdn Trust, Univ Hosp, Southampton, Hants, England; [Reynolds, Rebecca M.] Univ Edinburgh, Queens Med Res Inst, Univ BHF Ctr Cardiovascr Sci, Endocrinol Unit, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Paediat & Child Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia; [Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Telethon Kids Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Nyirenda, Moffat] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Nyirenda, Moffat] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Blantyre, Malawi; [Jaddoe, Vincent W.

Identification of individuals in clusters with comorbid symptoms may reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets. The aim of this research was to combine machine-learning (ML) algorithms with traditional regression techniques by utilising self-reported medical symptoms to identify and describe clusters of individuals with increased rates of depression from a large cross-sectional community based population epidemiological study. Methods A multi-staged methodology utilising ML and traditional statistical techniques was performed using the community based population National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009 - 2010) (N = 3,922). A Self-organised Mapping (SOM) ML algorithm, combined with hierarchical clustering, was performed to create participant clusters based on 68 medical symptoms. Binary logistic regression, controlling for sociodemographic confounders, was used to then identify the key clusters of participants with higher levels of depression (PHQ-9 >= 10, n = 377). Finally, a Multiple Additive Regression Tree boosted ML algorithm was run to identify the important medical symptoms for each key cluster within 17 broad categories: heart, liver, thyroid, respiratory, diabetes, arthritis, fractures and osteoporosis, skeletal pain, blood pressure, blood transfusion, cholesterol, vision, hearing, psoriasis, weight, bowels and urinary. Results Five clusters of participants, based on medical symptoms, were identified to have significantly increased rates of depression compared to the cluster with the lowest rate: odds ratios ranged from 2.24 ( 95% CI 1.56, 3.24) to 6.33 ( 95% CI 1.67, 24.02). The ML boosted regression algorithm identified three key medical condition categories as being significantly more common in these clusters: bowel, pain and urinary symptoms. Bowel- related symptoms was found to dominate the relative importance of symptoms within the five key clusters. Conclusion This methodology shows promise for the identification of conditions in general populations and supports the current focus on the potential importance of bowel symptoms and the gut in mental health research.","[Dipnall, Joanna F.; Pasco, Julie A.; Berk, Michael; Williams, Lana J.; Dodd, Seetal; Jacka, Felice N.] Deakin Univ, Sch Med, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Dipnall, Joanna F.; Meyer, Denny] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Stat, Data Sci & Epidemiol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pasco, Julie A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Clin School, Western Campus, St Albans, Vic, Australia; [Pasco, Julie A.] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pasco, Julie A.; Berk, Michael; Williams, Lana J.; Dodd, Seetal] Univ Hosp Geelong, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael; Dodd, Seetal; Jacka, Felice N.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael; Dodd, Seetal] Natl Ctr Excellence Youth Mental Hlth, Orygen, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice N.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Adolescent Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice N.] Black Dog Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia","NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1059660, 1064272, 1108125, GNT1064272]",MB is supported by a NHMRC Senior Principal Research Fellowship 1059660.

The informational processuality within this continuity can be used as to exemplify the insufficiency of hierarchical concepts in grasping the complex and integrated nature of biological processes. The argument follows Bruni and Giorgi (Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 119, 481-92, 2015) in emphasizing that while structures and substrates are organized hierarchically, communicational processes are organized heterarchically. The essay also argues the insufficiency of a single, basic, i.e. genetic level of description, which is the prevalent idea of twentieth century biology, to explain all phenotypic variation. I argue that inheritance and development cannot be fully explained by some sub- or super-ordination and that such descriptions are merely heuristic tools that do not reflect the nature of such processes.","[Svorcova, Jana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic","project Linguistic and lexicostatic analysis in collaboration of linguistics, mathematics, biology and psychology [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0161]; Grant Agency of The Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-24275S]; Charles University in Prague within UNCE project [204004]","This paper was supported by the project Linguistic and lexicostatic analysis in collaboration of linguistics, mathematics, biology and psychology no.

Recent studies suggest that infants who develop dysbiosis may be at risk for lifelong adverse health consequences. Exposure to opioid drugs during pregnancy is a factor of potential importance for microbiome health that has not yet been investigated. Since these infants are born after an entire gestation exposed to mu opioid receptor agonists and have severe gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, we hypothesize that these infants are at risk for dysbiosis. We speculate that opioid exposure during gestation and development of NAS at birth may lead to a dysbiotic gut microbiome, which may impair normal microbiome succession and development, and impact future health of these children.

Among scientists and the public in the United States, on the other hand, the microbiome, seen as the internal ecosystem' that regulates the workings of human guts, is a regular topic of conversation. This raises questions about how one might go about doing a social study of the microbiome in places where it does not (yet) exist as a category of expert practice or public discourse. Evidence from Nicaragua and the United States highlights two sites at which experts engage people in research and discussion about microbial ecologies. In their work, U.S. microbiome scientists and Nicaraguan public health workers both engage in paraethnography,' the practice of collecting and analyzing qualitative information that does not fit into statistical or other kinds of scientific models. In the United States, paraethnography has driven both traditional scientific experiments on the microbiome and online, crowd-sourced experimental platforms for collecting and analyzing information about gut microbes. In Nicaragua, hygienists generate paraethnographic evidence through word-of-mouth, radio, and print media. A comparison between the work of U.S. scientists and that of Nicaraguan hygienists suggests three different ways (commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic) in which the cultural/interpretive evidence of paraethnography interfaces symbiotically with the quantitative/statistical evidence of bioscience. Attention to evidentiary symbiosis provides insights into the operations of publicly oriented science under conditions of bodily and planetary uncertainty.","[Nading, Alex] Univ Edinburgh, Social Anthropol, 15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH1 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",Social Science Research Council; Fulbright Hays; National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0849650],"Funding for the original research was provided by the Social Science Research Council, Fulbright Hays, and a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [No. 0849650].",6,DEC,2016,25,4,10.1080/09505431.2016.1202226,Cultural Studies; History & Philosophy Of Science

CS is associated with childhood obesity; however, little is known whether this relationship varies by race. We examined if the association of CS with obesity at age 2 years varied by race. Design: Longitudinal birth cohort. Setting: Birth cohort conducted in a health care system in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan with follow-up at age 2 years. Participants: 639 birth cohort participants; 367 children (57.4%) were born to African American mothers and 230 (36.0%) children were born via CS. Main Outcome Measure: Obesity defined as body mass index >= 95th percentile at age 2 years. Results: Slightly more children of African American (n=37; 10.1%) than non-African American mothers (n=18; 6.6%) were obese (P=.12). There was evidence of effect modification between race and delivery mode with obesity at age 2 years (interaction P=.020). In children of African American mothers, CS compared to vaginal birth was associated with a significantly higher odds of obesity (aOR=2.35 (95% CI: 1.16, 4.77), P=.017). In contrast, delivery mode was not associated with obesity at age 2 years in children of non-African American mothers (aOR=.47 (95% CI:.13, 1.71), P=.25). Conclusions: There is evidence for a race-specific effect of CS on obesity at age 2 years; potential underlying mechanisms may be racial differences in the developing gut microbiome or in epigenetic programming. Future research is needed to determine if this racial difference persists into later childhood.","[Cassidy-Bushrow, Andrea E.; Wegienka, Ganesa; Havstad, Suzanne; Levin, Albert M.; Woodcroft, Kimberley J.; Johnson, Christine Cole] Henry Ford Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, One Ford Pl, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Ownby, Dennis R.] Georgia Regents Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Allergy & Clin Immunol, Augusta, GA USA; [Rundle, Andrew G.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY USA; [Zoratti, Edward M.] Henry Ford Hosp, Div Allergy & Clin Immunol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Lynch, Susan V.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 AI050681, R01 HL113010, P01 AI089473]; Fund for Henry Ford Hospital","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 AI050681, R01 HL113010 and P01 AI089473) and the Fund for Henry Ford Hospital.",2,WIN,2016,26,1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The pathophysiologic mechanism of MS is not well known. It has been suggested that alterations in the normal gut flora may contribute to MS etiology and symptoms. Objective: The aims of this review are to describe the data suggesting a role for the gut microbiome in MS research and address its implications for practice. Methods: A literature search of the following databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane library database, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences) was conducted to find published studies relevant to gut microbiome in patients with MS. Study Selection: Five articles met the inclusion criteria of research studies of human gut microbiome in adults in English language and those receiving disease-modifying medications. Exclusion criteria were case reports and reviews. Results: Human studies found that the gut microbiome was different among patients with MS, patients with MS who were treated with glatiramer acetate, and healthy controls. Discussion: There is beginning evidence to suggest that the gut microbiota is related to autoimmunity and the pathology of MS. However, more research is necessary to clarify these mechanisms. Implications for Practice: A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in MS may lead to the development of targeted individualized interventions affecting the gut microbiota. These interventions may emphasize symptom self-management strategies such as diet.","[Newland, Pamela K.] Barnes Jewish Coll, Goldfarb Sch Nursing, Nursing Fac, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Heitkemper, Margaret] Univ Washington, Sch Nursing, Dept Biobehav Nursing & Hlth Syst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zhou, Yanjiao] Jackson Lab Genom Med, Farmington, CT USA",,,14,DEC,2016,48,6,10.1097/JNN.0000000000000252,Clinical Neurology; Nursing

Understanding the causes and consequences of neuroinflammation could, therefore, provide insight that is needed to improve therapeutic interventions across many diseases. However, the complexity of the pathways involved necessitates the use of high-throughput approaches to extensively interrogate the process, and appropriate strategies to translate the data generated into clinical benefit. Use of 'big data' aims to generate, integrate and analyse large, heterogeneous datasets to provide in-depth insights into complex processes, and has the potential to unravel the complexities of neuroinflammation. Limitations in data analysis approaches currently prevent the full potential of big data being reached, but some aspects of big data are already yielding results. The implementation of 'omics' analyses in particular is becoming routine practice in biomedical research, and neuroimaging is producing large sets of complex data. In this Review, we evaluate the impact of the drive to collect and analyse big data on our understanding of neuroinflammation in disease. We describe the breadth of big data that are leading to an evolution in our understanding of this field, exemplify how these data are beginning to be of use in a clinical setting, and consider possible future directions.","[Dendrou, Calliope A.; Fugger, Lars] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford Ctr Neuroinflammat, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; [Dendrou, Calliope A.; Fugger, Lars] Univ Oxford, MRC Human Immunol Unit, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; [McVean, Cil] Univ Oxford, Big Data Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Informat & Discovery, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [McVean, Cil] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England",Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_UU_12010/3]; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [100308]; Rosetrees TrustRosetrees Trust [M85-F1],,12,DEC,2016,12,12,10.1038/nrneurol.2016.171,Clinical Neurology

Besides genetic risks, environmental factors have been suggested to contribute to the increase in ASD diagnosis over the past decade. Several studies have reported abnormalities in microbiota composition and differences in microbial metabolites in children with ASD. Gastrointestinal discomfort is commonly reported in children with ASD. Additionally, food selectivity and picky eating patterns are commonly reported. A number of mechanisms underlying the interaction between nutrition, the gut microbiota, and ASD symptoms via the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been proposed, including immune, hormonal, or neuronal pathways. Here, the current evidence base regarding the gut environment and nutritional status of children with ASD is reviewed. Potential underlying mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in ASD and the interplay between nutrition, microbiota, and ASD symptoms are also reviewed. Future studies investigating the microbiota in the context of dietary intake are needed to increase understanding of the interplay between diet and the gut microbiota in ASD and to identify potential dietary, probiotic, or prebiotic intervention strategies.","[Berding, Kirsten; Donovan, Sharon M.] Univ Illinois, Div Nutr Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Donovan, Sharon M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, 339 Bevier Hall,905 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,,29,DEC,2016,74,12,10.1093/nutrit/nuw048,Nutrition & Dietetics

While historically studied by researching the brain, inputs from the periphery impact many neurological conditions. Indeed, emerging data suggest communication between the gut and the brain in anxiety, depression, cognition, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The development of a healthy, functional brain depends on key pre-and post-natal events that integrate environmental cues, such as molecular signals from the gut. These cues largely originate from the microbiome, the consortium of symbiotic bacteria that reside within all animals. Research over the past few years reveals that the gut microbiomeplays a role in basic neurogenerative processes such as the formation of the blood-brain barrier, myelination, neurogenesis, and microglia maturation and also modulates many aspects of animal behavior. Herein, we discuss the biological intersection of neurodevelopment and the microbiome and explore the hypothesis that gut bacteria are integral contributors to development and function of the nervous system and to the balance between mental health and disease.","[Sharon, Gil; Sampson, Timothy R.; Mazmanian, Sarkis K.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurobehav Genet, Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurogenet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Ctr Autism Treatment & Res, Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Meixner Postdoctoral Fellowship in Translational Research; Larry L.

Providing the host with functions important to regulate energetic homeostasis and immunological function, the gut microbiota is strategic to keep metabolic and immunological homeostasis during the entire lifespan. Scope and approach: In the present work we review studies exploring human gut microbiota variations at different age, describing the trajectory of ecosystem changes during the course of our life, from infancy to the old age. Gut microbiota variation mirroring subsistence strategy is also explored, with a particular focus on how the gut microbiota changes in response to modifications in the diet. Finally, we illustrate how an abnormal dietary intake could force microbiota to an obese-associated configuration, which concurs in compromising the host metabolic homeostasis. Key findings and conclusions: Our work allows appreciating the importance of the physiological flexibility conferred by the microbiota for modulating our metabolic and immunological phenotype along the course of our life. Further, the key role of the gut microbiota in providing an extra means of adaptive potential during our evolutionary history is highlighted, suggesting the importance of the intestinal microbiota-host interplay for the maintenance of human health and homeostasis in changing environments. On the other hand, different lifestyle and dietary factors, such as sanitization and antibiotic usage or high-fat diet, can force maladaptive changes in the microbiota configuration which could have negative effects on human health. Thus, it is important to modulate diet and lifestyle habits to keep a mutualistic gut microbiota layout along the course of our life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Dubos (1901-1982) conducted groundbreaking studies concerning early-life environmental exposures (e.g., diet, social interactions, commensal microbiota, housing conditions) and adult disease. However, Dubos looked beyond the scientific focus on disease, arguing that ""mere survival is not enough"". He defined mental health as fulfilling human potential, and expressed concerns about urbanization occurring in tandem with disappearing access to natural environments (and elements found within them); thus modernity could interfere with health via ""missing exposures"". With the advantage of emerging research involving green space, the microbiome, biodiversity and positive psychology, we discuss ecological justice in the dysbiosphere and the forces-financial inequity, voids in public policy, marketing and otherwise-that interfere with the fundamental rights of children to thrive in a healthy urban ecosystem and learn respect for the natural environment. We emphasize health within the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) rubric and suggest that greater focus on positive exposures might uncover mechanisms of resiliency that contribute to maximizing human potential. We will entrain our perspective to socioeconomic disadvantage in developed nations and what we have described as ""grey space""; this is a mental as much as a physical environment, a space that serves to insidiously reinforce unhealthy behavior, compromise positive psychological outlook and, ultimately, trans-generational health.

Drawing upon the Equilibrium Model of Immunity (Eberl in Nat Rev Immunol 16:524-532, 2016), we argue that microorganisms are scaffolds of immune capacities and processes that determine the constituency and persistence of the host organism. A scaffolding perspective accommodates the contingency and heterogeneity of resident microorganisms while accounting for their necessity and unifying contributions to host individuality.

When such a full ecological alignment is adopted, the immune system becomes the mediator of both defensive and assimilative environmental intercourse, where a balance of immune rejection and tolerance governs the complex interactions of the organism's ecological relationships. Accordingly, immunology, which historically had affiliated with the biology of individuals, now becomes a science concerned with the biology of communities. With this translocation, the ontological basis of the organism is undergoing a profound change. Indeed, the recent recognition of the ubiquity of symbiosis has challenged the traditional notions of biological individuality and requires a shift in the metaphysics undergirding biology, in which a philosophy of the organism must be characterized by ecological dialectics ""all-the-way-down."".","[Gilbert, Scott F.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, 500 Coll Ave, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Tauber, Alfred I.] Boston Univ, Dept Philosophy, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Swarthmore College; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"SFG is funded by Swarthmore College and the National Science Foundation, and he wishes to thank Dr. Heather Davis and Sarah R.

A maladaptive stress response is implicated in both mental health disorders and metabolic disorders, implicating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis as a key mediator of this relationship. This review explores how an altered energetic state, such as hyper- or hypoglycemia, as may be manifested in obesity or diabetes, affects the stress response and the HPA axis in particular. We propose that changes in energetic state or energetic demands can result in ""energetic stress"" that can, if prolonged, lead to a dysfunctional stress response. In this review, we summarize the role of the hypothalamus in modulating energy homeostasis and then briefly discuss the relationship between metabolism and stress-induced activation of the HPA axis. Next, we examine seven mechanisms whereby energetic stress interacts with neuroendocrine stress response systems, including by glucocorticoid signaling both within and beyond the HPA axis; by nutrient-induced changes in glucocorticoid signaling; by impacting the sympathetic nervous system; through changes in other neuroendocrine factors; by inducing inflammatory changes; and by altering the gut-brain axis. Recognizing these effects of energetic stress can drive novel therapies and prevention strategies for mental health disorders, including dietary intervention, probiotics, and even fecal transplant.

Information, communication, and computing technologies are now part of every societal domain and support essentially every facet of human activity. Ubiquitous computing, a vision articulated fewer than 30 years ago, has now arrived. Simultaneously, there is a global crisis in health through the combination of lifestyle and age-related chronic disease and multiple comorbidities. Computationally intensive health behavior interventions may be one of the most powerful methods to reduce the consequences of this crisis, but new methods are needed for health research and practice, and evidence is needed to support their widespread use. The challenges are many, including a reluctance to abandon timeworn theories and models of health behavior-and health interventions more broadly-that emerged in an era of self-reported data; medical models of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; and scientific methods grounded in sparse and expensive data. There are also many challenges inherent in demonstrating that newer approaches are, indeed, effective. Potential solutions may be found in leveraging methods of research that have been shown to be successful in other domains, particularly engineering. A more ""agile science"" may be needed that streamlines the methods through which elements of health interventions are shown to work or not, and to more rapidly deploy and iteratively improve those that do. There is much to do to advance the issues discussed in this paper, and the papers in this theme issue. It remains an open question whether interventions based in these new models and methods are, in fact, equally if not more efficacious as what is available currently. Economic analyses of these new approaches are needed because assumptions of net worth compared to other approaches are just that, assumptions. Human-centered design research is needed to ensure that users ultimately benefit. Finally, a translational research agenda will be needed, as the status quo will likely be resistant to change.

The definition that we find generally useful is that an organism is a unit in which all the subunits have evolved to be highly cooperative, with very little conflict. We focus on how often organisms evolve from two or more formerly independent organisms. Two canonical transitions of this type-replicators clustered in cells and endosymbiotic organelles within host cells-demonstrate the reality of this kind of evolutionary transition and suggest conditions that can favor it. These conditions include co-transmission of the partners across generations and rules that strongly regulate and limit conflict, such as a fair meiosis. Recently, much attention has been given to associations of animals with microbes involved in their nutrition. These range from tight endosymbiotic associations like those between aphids and Buchnera bacteria, to the complex communities in animal intestines. Here, starting with a reflection about identity through time (which we call ""Theseus's fish""), we consider the distinctions between these kinds of animal-bacteria interactions and describe the criteria by which a few can be considered jointly organismal but most cannot.","[Queller, David C.; Strassmann, Joan E.] Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Biol, CB 1137,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","John Templeton Foundation [43667]; USA National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS1256416, DEB1146375]",We thank Thomas Pradeu for encouraging this work and for stimulating discussion and helpful comments.

PPA is a normal intermediate of metabolism and is found in foods, either naturally or as a preservative. PPA and its derivatives have been implicated in both health and disease. Whereas PPA is an energy substrate and has many proposed beneficial effects, it is also associated with human disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunction, including propionic acidemia and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We aimed to investigate the dichotomy between the health and disease effects of PPA by measuring mitochondrial function in ASD and age-and gender-matched control lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) following incubation with PPA at several concentrations and durations both with and without an in vitro increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial function was optimally increased at particular exposure durations and concentrations of PPA with ASD LCLs, demonstrating a greater enhancement. In contrast, increasing ROS negated the positive PPA effect with the ASD LCLs, showing a greater detriment. These data demonstrate that enteric microbiome metabolites such as PPA can have both beneficial and toxic effects on mitochondrial function, depending on concentration, exposure duration and microenvironment redox state with these effects amplified in LCLs derived from individuals with ASD. As PPA, as well as enteric bacteria, which produce PPA, have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including ASD, diabetes, obesity and inflammatory diseases, insight into this metabolic modulator from the host microbiome may have wide applications for both health and disease.","[Frye, R.

Here we present a study of the salivary microbiome within a North American Indian community. This research is the culmination of four years of collaboration and community engagement with Cheyenne & Arapaho (C&A) tribal members from western Oklahoma. Materials and Methods: Using 16S rRNA gene amplification and next-generation sequencing, we generated microbial taxonomic inventories for 37 individuals representing five towns within the C&A tribes. For comparison, we performed the same laboratory techniques on saliva samples from 20 non-native individuals (NNI) from Norman, Oklahoma. Results: The C&A participants differ from the NNI in having reduced within-individual species richness and higher between-individual variation. Unsupervised clustering analyses reveal that three ecological groupings best fit the data, and while C&A individuals include assignments to all three groups, the NNI individuals are assigned to only one group. One of the ecological groups found exclusively among C&A participants was characterized by high abundance of the oral bacterial genus Prevotella. Discussion: The C&A and NNI participants from Oklahoma have notable differences in their microbiome diversity, with a wider range of variation observed among the C&A individuals, including a higher frequency of bacteria implicated in systemic disorders. Overall, this study highlights the importance of engagement with indigenous communities, and the need for an improved understanding of human microbiome diversity among underrepresented groups and those individuals living outside of metropolitan areas.","[Ozga, Andrew T.; Sankaranarayanan, Krithivasan; Tito, Raul Y.; Obregon-Tito, Alexandra J.; Spicer, Paul; Warinner, Christina G.; Lewis, Cecil M., Jr.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Anthropol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Foster, Morris W.] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Tallbull, Gloria; Spicer, Paul; Lewis, Cecil M., Jr.] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Appl Social Res, Norman, OK 73019 USA","CA community; C&A Tribal Health Board; BioProject [PRJNA292800]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01HG005172, R01GM089886]","This research would not have been possible without the interest and support of the C&A community and the C&A Tribal Health Board.

However, the results of a few recent studies carried out in this area have produced controversies. There is evidence that human fecal samples, used in most human microbiome studies, may provide a poor representation of microbial contents of the proximal intestine. Furthermore, fecal short chain fatty acid levels do not exemplify the amount of short chain fatty acids produced in the intestine. Short chain fatty acids are largely absorbed in the intestine by a tightly regulated mechanism.

Purpose: To review relevant literature about bathing newborn infants, as well as examine the controversies about bathing NICU patients including the use of daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) baths. Findings: Despite studies showing that temperature can be maintained when the first bath was at 1 hour after delivery, there are benefits from delaying the bath including improved breastfeeding. Tub or immersion bathing improves temperature, and is less stressful. It is not necessary to bathe infants every day, and premature infants can be bathed as little as every 4 days without an increase in skin colonization. No differences have been reported in skin parameters such as pH, transepidermal water loss, and stratum corneum hydration whether the first and subsequent baths are given using water alone or water and a mild baby cleanser. Concerns about systemic absorption suggests caution about widespread practice of daily CHG bathing in the NICU until it is known whether CHG crosses the blood-brain barrier, particularly in premature infants. Implications for Practice and Research: Research regarding bathing practices for NICU patients should be evidence-based whenever possible, such as the benefits of immersion bathing. More evidence about the risks and benefits of daily CHG bathing is needed before this practice is widely disseminated.","[Lund, Carolyn] UCSF Benioff Childrens Hosp Oakland, Neonatal Intens Care Unit, 747 52nd St, Oakland, CA 94609 USA",Johnson & Johnson Consumer Co Inc,"Recipient of an investigator-initiated grant from Johnson & Johnson Consumer Co Inc, to study the impact of the newborn's first bath on skin barrier function and the skin microbiome.",11,OCT,2016,16,5,10.1097/ANC.0000000000000336,Nursing

X-ray microtomography (Micro-CT) may provide a non-destructive means of investigating taphonomically-significant diagenetic alterations throughout whole bone samples, but this method has not been tested systematically (Dal Sasso et al., 2014). Bacterial bioerosion is the most common form of diagenesis found in archaeological bones, yet a recent large-scale study of European archaeological human bones found that an unusually high proportion of young infant (<1 month old) samples were free from bacterial attack (Booth, 2016). This result is best explained by the remains of stillborn or short-lived infants who had died before their osteolytic gut bacteria had developed. The ability to differentiate between stillborn and short-lived infants would profoundly impact on the study of past human life courses and the study of infanticide in both archaeological and forensic contexts. In this study we investigate the efficacy of micro-CT in studying bone diagenesis by scanning three archaeological human femoral samples where levels of diagenesis are known and varied, before scanning a novel sample set of ten Romano-British young infant/perinatal femora to test the dichotomous appearance of bioerosion. We find that micro-CT is a viable non-destructive method of investigating bone bioerosion, but is less useful for characterising diagenetic staining and inclusions. Half of the infant samples studied here were free from bacterial bioerosion, further suggesting that histological analysis can be used to identify archaeological remains of stillborn and short-lived infants.

Key products of the microbiota are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid. Butyrate is a functionally versatile molecule that is produced in the mammalian gut by fermentation of dietary fibre and is-enriched in butter and other dairy products. Butyrate along with other fermentation derived SCFAs (e.g. acetate, propionate) and the structurally related ketone bodies (e.g. acetoacetate and n-beta-hydroxybutyrate) show promising effects in various diseases including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory (bowel) diseases, and colorectal cancer as well as neurological disorders. Indeed, it is clear that host energy metabolism and immune functions critically depend on butyrate as a potent regulator, highlighting butyrate as a key mediator of host-microbe crosstalk. In addition to specific receptors (GPR43/FFAR2; GPR41/FFAR3; GPR109a/HCAR2) and transporters (MCT1/SLC16A1; SMCT1/SLC5A8), its effects are mediated by utilisation as an energy source via the (3-oxidation pathway and as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), promoting histone acetylation and stimulation of gene expression in host cells. The latter has also led to the use of butyrate as an experimental drug in models for neurological disorders ranging from depression to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. Here we provide a critical review of the literature on butyrate and its effects on multiple aspects of host physiology with a focus on brain function and behaviour. We find fundamental differences in natural butyrate at physiological concentrations and its use as a neuropharmacological agent at rather high, supraphysiological doses in brain research. Finally, we hypothesise that butyrate and other volatile SCFAs produced by microbes may be involved in regulating the impact of the microbiome on behaviour including social communication.

Recent technological innovations, such as next-generation DNA sequencing, also known as deep sequencing or pyrosequencing, have enhanced clinicians' capacity to identify, characterize, and elucidate the role of BB (ie, bacterial load, diversity, pathogenicity) in human immunity, disease, and metabolic processes. The understanding of common terminology, intervening variables that influence BB, limitations of next-generation DNA sequencing, and specimen selection, collection, transport, and storage practices are needed to support interdisciplinary communication, research design, and integrity of the specimen.

This process, digestion, is catalyzed by enzymes that are either endogenous or produced by the host's microbial population.(1) Research shows that the nutritional value of food is partially constrained by the digestive abilities of the microbial community present in the host's gut and that these microbes rapidly adapt to changes in diet and other environmental pressures.(2) An accumulating body of evidence suggests that endogenously produced digestive enzymes also have been, and still are, common targets of natural selection, further cementing their crucial role in an organism's digestive system.(3-5)","[Janiak, Mareike Cora] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Brunswick, NJ USA",,,10,SEP-OCT,2016,25,5,10.1002/evan.21498,Anthropology

This study examines whether gut microbiome disturbances are present in the BTBRT + tf/j (BTBR) mouse model of ASD and if the ketogenic diet, a diet previously shown to elicit therapeutic benefit in this mouse model, is capable of altering the profile. Findings: Juvenile male C57BL/6 (B6) and BTBR mice were fed a standard chow (CH, 13 % kcal fat) or ketogenic diet (KD, 75 % kcal fat) for 10-14 days. Following diets, fecal and cecal samples were collected for analysis. Main findings are as follows: (1) gut microbiota compositions of cecal and fecal samples were altered in BTBR compared to control mice, indicating that this model may be of utility in understanding gut-brain interactions in ASD; (2) KD consumption caused an anti-microbial-like effect by significantly decreasing total host bacterial abundance in cecal and fecal matter; (3) specific to BTBR animals, the KD counteracted the common ASD phenotype of a low Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in both sample types; and (4) the KD reversed elevated Akkermansia muciniphila content in the cecal and fecal matter of BTBR animals. Conclusions: Results indicate that consumption of a KD likely triggers reductions in total gut microbial counts and compositional remodeling in the BTBR mouse. These findings may explain, in part, the ability of a KD to mitigate some of the neurological symptoms associated with ASD in an animal model.","[Newell, Christopher; Reimer, Raylene A.; Hittel, Dustin S.; Shearer, Jane] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 3330 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Bomhof, Marc R.; Reimer, Raylene A.; Shearer, Jane] Univ Calgary, Fac Kinesiol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Rho, Jong M.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Rho, Jong M.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Rho, Jong M.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Calgary, AB, Canada",MitoCanada PhD Scholarship; Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions MD/PhD Studentship; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation; MitoCanada; Alberta Innovates [201600312],CN is funded by a MitoCanada PhD Scholarship and an Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions MD/PhD Studentship.

This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders.

Multiple factors were associated with neonatal gut microbiome composition in both single-and multi-factor models, with independent contributions of maternal race-ethnicity, breastfeeding, mode of delivery, marital status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and indoor pets. These findings were consistent in the infants, and networks demonstrating the shared impact of factors on gut microbial composition also showed notable topological similarity between neonates and infants.

They regulate the response to stressful stimuli through direct activation of adrenergic receptors in the central and sympathetic nervous systems, hormonal activity and through the interaction of the brain, gut, and microbiome. The multiple functions of these catecholamines work synergistically to prepare an individual for a ""fight or flight"" response. However, hyper-reactivity of this system can lead to increased fearfulness and aggression, decreased health and productivity, and a reduction in overall well-being. Behaviors, such as aggression and certain fear-related behaviors, are a serious problem in the poultry industry that can lead to injury and cannibalism. For decades, catecholamines have been used as a measure of stress in animals. However, few studies have specifically targeted the adrenergic systems as means to reduce behaviors that are damaging or maladapted to their rearing environments and improve animal well-being.

How many insights into human evolutionary biology and disease susceptibilities could be gained, even with this relatively recent window into the past? In this article, we explore the potential ramifications of a newly constructed dataset of Four Centuries of African American Biological Variation (4Cs). Methods: This article provides initial lists of digitized variables formatted as SQL tables for the 17th and 18th century samples and for the 19th and 20th century samples. Results: This database is dynamic and new information is added yearly. The database provides novel opportunities for significant insights into the past biological history of this group and three case study applications are detailed for comparative computational systems biology studies of (1) hypertension, (2) the oral microbiome, and (3) mental health disorders. Conclusions: The 4Cs dataset is ideal for interdisciplinary ""next generation"" science research and these data represent a unique step toward the accumulation of historically contextualized Big Data on an underrepresented group known to have experienced differential survival over time.

Elevated p-cresol amounts have been previously found in the urines of Italian and French autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children up until 8 years of age, and may be associated with autism severity or with the intensity of abnormal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the mechanism producing elevated urinary p-cresol in ASD. Urinary p-cresol levels were thus measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography in a sample of 53 Italian ASD children assessed for (a) presence of Clostridium spp. strains in the gut by means of an in vitro fecal stool test and of Clostridium difficile-derived toxin A/B in the feces, (b) intestinal permeability using the lactulose/mannitol (LA/MA) test, (c) frequent use of antibiotics due to recurrent infections during the first 2 years of postnatal life, and (d) stool habits with the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Chronic constipation was the only variable significantly associated with total urinary p-cresol concentration (P < 0.05). No association was found with presence of Clostridium spp. in the gut flora (P = 0.92), augmented intestinal permeability (P = 0.18), or frequent use of antibiotics in early infancy (P = 0.47). No ASD child was found to carry C. difficile in the gut or to release toxin A/B in the feces. In conclusion, urinary p-cresol levels are elevated in young ASD children with increased intestinal transit time and chronic constipation.

However, the role of obligate anaerobes therein remains to be established, and it is still unclear which bacterial species, if any, are most important in the production and/or elimination of carcinogenic acetaldehyde under such conditions. This study was undertaken to address these issues. More than 500 bacterial strains were isolated from the faeces of Japanese alcoholics and phylogenetically characterized, and their aerobic ethanol metabolism was studied in vitro to examine their ability to accumulate acetaldehyde beyond the minimum mutagenic concentration (MMC, 50 A mu M). Bacterial strains that were considered to potentially accumulate acetaldehyde beyond the MMC under aerobic conditions in the colon and rectum were identified and referred to as 'potential acetaldehyde accumulators' (PAAs). Ruminococcus, an obligate anaerobe, was identified as a genus that includes a large number of PAAs. Other obligate anaerobes were also found to include PAAs. The accumulation of acetaldehyde by PAAs colonizing the colorectal mucosal surface could be described, at least in part, as the response of PAAs to oxidative stress. Ethanol oxidation by intestinal obligate anaerobes under aerobic conditions in the colon and rectum could also play an important role in the pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer.","[Tsuruya, Atsuki; Kuwahara, Akika; Saito, Yuta; Yamaguchi, Haruhiko; Tenma, Natsuki; Inai, Makoto; Takahashi, Seiji; Shimoyama, Takefumi; Nakayama, Toru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Biomol Engn, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan; [Tsutsumi, Eri; Suwa, Yoshihide] Suntory Holdings Ltd, Suntory World Res Ctr, Kyoto 6190284, Japan; [Totsuka, Yukari] Natl Canc Ctr, Div Carcinogenesis & Canc Prevent, Res Inst, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Suda, Wataru; Oshima, Kenshiro; Hattori, Masahira] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Omics & Bioinformat, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Yokoyama, Akira] Kurihama Med & Addict Ctr, Natl Hosp Org, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2390841, Japan","National Cancer Center Research Institute; Asahi Glass Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24651232]","This research was funded by the National Cancer Center Research Institute (T.N.), the Asahi Glass Foundation (T.S.), and a Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research (T.S.; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant number 24651232).",12,JUL-AUG,2016,51,4,10.1093/alcalc/agv135,Substance Abuse

Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) is an integrative transdisciplinary science based on the unique disease principle and the disease continuum theory. While it has been most commonly applied to research on breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, MPE can investigate etiologic heterogeneity in non-neoplastic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, drug toxicity, and immunity-related and infectious diseases. This science can enhance causal inference by linking putative etiologic factors to specific molecular biomarkers as outcomes. Technological advances increasingly enable analyses of various -omics, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, microbiome, immunomics, interactomics, etc. Challenges in MPE include sample size limitations (depending on availability of biospecimens or biomedical/radiological imaging), need for rigorous validation of molecular assays and study findings, and paucities of interdisciplinary experts, education programs, international forums, and standardized guidelines. To address these challenges, there are ongoing efforts such as multidisciplinary consortium pooling projects, the International Molecular Pathological Epidemiology Meeting Series, and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-MPE guideline project. Efforts should be made to build biorepository and biobank networks, and worldwide population-based MPE databases.

Methods: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. Results: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe-host interactions, the term hygiene hypothesis' is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. Conclusion: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term hygiene hypothesis' must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease.","[Bloomfield, Sally F.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Montacute TA15 6XL, Somerset, England; [Bloomfield, Sally F.] Int Sci Forum Home Hyg, Montacute TA15 6XL, Somerset, England; [Rook, Graham A.

Researchers have proposed that gut microbiota may influence dietary habits, and pathways through the microbiota-gut-brain axis make such a relationship feasible; however, few data bear on the hypothesis. As a first step in the development of a model system, the gut microbiome was examined in rat lines selectively outbred on a taste phenotype with biobehavioral profiles that have diverged with respect to energy regulation, anxiety, and stress. Methods Occidental low and high-saccharin-consuming rats were assessed for body mass and chow, water, and saccharin intake; littermate controls had shared cages with rats in the experimental group but were not assessed. Cecum and colon microbial communities were profiled using Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing and multivariate analysis of microbial diversity and composition. Results The saccharin phenotype was confirmed (low-saccharin-consuming rats, 0.7% [0.9%]; high-saccharin-consuming rats, 28.1% [3.6%]). Regardless of saccharin exposure, gut microbiota differed between lines in terms of overall community similarity and taxa at lower phylogenetic levels. Specifically, 16 genera in three phyla distinguished the lines at a 10% false discovery rate. Discussion The study demonstrates for the first time that rodent lines created through selective pressure on taste and differing on functionally related correlates host different microbial communities. Whether the microbiota are causally related to the taste phenotype or its correlates remains to be determined. These findings encourage further inquiry on the relationship of the microbiome to taste, dietary habits, emotion, and health.","[Lyte, Mark] Iowa State Univ, Sch Vet Med, Dept Vet Microbiol & Prevent Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lyte, Mark] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Immunotherapeut & Biotechnol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Abilene, TX USA; [Fodor, Anthony A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Perez-Chanona, Ernesto] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jobin, Christian] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Chapman, Clinton D.; Martin, Gary G.; Dess, Nancy K.] Occidental Coll, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center; Gatorade Foundation,Funding was provided by Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center internal investigator research account (to M.L.) and the Gatorade Foundation (to C.J.).

We investigated the interactions between low socioeconomic status (SES) and infection in childhood and adverse cardiometabolic parameters in adulthood. METHODS:Participants from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, a cohort well phenotyped for childhood and adulthood cardiometabolic risk factors and socioeconomic parameters, were linked to lifetime hospitalization data from birth onward available from the Finnish National Hospital Registry. In those with complete data, we investigated relationships between infection-related hospitalization in childhood, SES, and childhood and adult cardiometabolic parameters. RESULTS:The study cohort consisted of 1015 participants (age range 3-18 years at baseline and 30-45 years at follow-up). In adults who were raised in below-median income families, childhood infection-related hospitalizations (at age 0-5 years) were significantly associated with higher adult BMI ( SE comparing those with 0 vs >= 1 hospitalizations 2.4 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2), P = .008), waist circumference (7.4 +/- 2.3 cm, P = .004), and reduced brachial flow-mediated dilatation (-2.7 +/- 0.9%, P = .002). No equivalent associations were observed in participants from higher-SES families. CONCLUSIONS:Infection was associated with worse cardiovascular risk factor profiles only in those from lower-SES families. Childhood infection may contribute to social gradients observed in adult cardiometabolic disease risk factors. These findings suggest reducing childhood infections, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged children, may reduce the cardiometabolic disease burden in adults.","[Liu, Richard S.; Burgner, David P.; Sabin, Matthew A.; Cheung, Michael; Juonala, Markus] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne Childrens Campus,50 Flemington Rd, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Liu, Richard S.; Burgner, David P.; Sabin, Matthew A.; Cheung, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Dept Pediat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Burgner, David P.] Monash Univ, Dept Pediat, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Magnussen, Costan G.; Raitakari, Olli T.] Univ Turku, Res Ctr Appl & Prevent Cardiovasc Med, Turku, Finland; [Viikari, Jorma S.

Known as precision medicine, this new healthcare model incorporates and integrates genetic information, microbiome data, and information on patients' environment and lifestyle to better identify and classify disease processes, and to provide custom-tailored therapeutic solutions. In spite of its promises, precision medicine faces several challenges that need to be overcome to successfully implement this new healthcare model. In this paper we identify four main areas that require attention: data, tools and systems, regulations, and people. While there are important ongoing efforts for addressing the first three areas, we argue that the human factor needs to be taken into consideration as well. In particular, we discuss several studies that show how primary care physicians and clinicians in general feel underequipped to interpret genetic tests and direct-to-consumer genomic tests. Considering the importance of genetic information for precision medicine applications, this is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. To increase the number of professionals with the necessary expertise to correctly interpret the genomics profiles of their patients, we propose several strategies that involve medical curriculum reforms, specialist training, and ongoing physician training.","[McGrath, Scott; Ghersi, Dario] Univ Nebraska, Sch Interdisciplinary Informat, 1110 S 67th St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",Nebraska Research Initiative grant,This work was partly supported by a Nebraska Research Initiative grant to D.G.,23,May-10,2016,9,,10.1186/s12920-016-0183-8,Genetics & Heredity

From an individual perspective, biological aspects, such as genetics, the microbiome, environmental hygiene, cytokines, and the nervous system, which are affected by cultural differences, all are relevant. Of equal importance are issues related to sex, symptom reporting and interpretation, and family systems. From the physician's viewpoint, understanding the patient's explanatory model of illness, especially in a cultural context, affects patient care and patient education in a multicultural environment. Differences in the definition and use of complementary and alternative medicine and other issues related to health care services for FGIDs are also a relevant cross-cultural issue.

To combat their disease, many individuals received either curative or palliative treatments that produced undesired symptoms. These symptoms, which often cause significant distress for individuals coping with cancer, may share biologic underpinnings such as epigenetic changes and immune dysregulation. Alterations in the normal flora of the gut may also influence cancer symptoms. Objective: The aim of this review is to describe the emerging role for the gut microbiome in cancer research, especially the potential relationship between the gut microbiome and cancer symptoms. Methods: Extant literature was reviewed and synthesized. Results: The majority of studies linking the gut microbiota and cancer are animal models and focus on the relationship between dysbiosis and colorectal cancer. Emerging evidence supports that the ""gut-brain"" connection is a plausible mechanism for ""psychoneurological"" cancer symptoms such as depression, pain, and fatigue. Conclusions: There is compelling evidence that the gut microbiota affects cancer via several mechanisms, including microbial diversity and number, metabolism, and/or immune initiation. However, more research is necessary to elucidate these mechanisms, particularly among a variety of cancers and cancer-related symptoms. Implications for Practice: A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in cancer symptoms may lead to the development of targeted individualized interventions affecting the gut microbiota that prevent or ameliorate dysbiosis, thereby reducing symptoms. These interventions may emphasize self-care management strategies essential for wellness, such as diet, nutrition, and stress reduction.","[Kelly, Debra Lynch; Lyon, Debra E.; Yoon, Saunjoo L.; Horgas, Ann L.] Univ Florida, Dept Biobehav Nursing Sci, Coll Nursing, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",,,5,MAY-JUN,2016,39,3,10.1097/NCC.0000000000000286,Oncology; Nursing

A health care provider can provide the patient with a framework in which to understand and legitimize their symptoms, remove self-doubt or blame, and identify factors that contribute to symptoms that the patient can influence or control. This framework is implemented with the consideration of important factors that impact FGIDs, such as gender, age, society, and the patient's perspective. Although the majority of FGIDs, including globus, rumination syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating, constipation, functional abdominal pain, sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia, pelvic floor dysfunction, and extraintestinal manifestations, are more prevalent in women than in men, functional chest pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, and anorectal pain do not appear to vary by gender. Studies have suggested sex differences in somatic, but not visceral, pain perception, motility, and central processing of visceral pain; although further research is required in autonomic nervous system dysfunction, genetics, and immunologic/microbiome. Gender differences in response to psychological treatments, antidepressants, fiber, probiotics, and anticholinergics have not been studied adequately.

J,"Blaser, Martin J.",Antibiotic use and its consequences for the normal microbiome,SCIENCE,English,Editorial Material,,GUT MICROBIOTA; ADIPOSITY,"Anti-infectives, including antibiotics, are essentially different from all other drugs; they not only affect the individual to whom they are given but also the entire community, through selection for resistance to their own action. Thus, their use resides at the intersection of personal and public health. Antibiotics can be likened to a four-edged sword against bacteria. The first two edges of the antibiotic sword were identified immediately after their discovery and deployment in that they not only benefit an individual in treating their infection but also benefit the community in preventing the spread of that infectious agent. The third edge was already recognized by Alexander Fleming in 1945 in his Nobel acceptance speech, which warned about the cost to the community of antibiotic resistance that would inevitably evolve and be selected for during clinical practice. We have seen this cost mount up, as resistance curtails or precludes the activities of some of our most effective drugs for clinically important infections. But the fourth edge of the antibiotic sword remained unappreciated until recently, i.e., the cost that an antibiotic exerts on an individual's own health via the collateral damage of the drug on bacteria that normally live on or in healthy humans: our microbiota. These organisms, their genes, metabolites, and interactions with one another, as well as with their host collectively, represent our microbiome. Our relationship with these symbiotic bacteria is especially important during the early years of life, when the adult microbiome has not yet formed.","[Blaser, Martin J.] NYULMC, Dept Med, Div Translat Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Blaser, Martin J.] NYULMC, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Blaser, Martin J.] Dept Vet Affairs Nev York Harbor Med Ctr, New York, NY 10010 USA","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI122285, U01 AI122285]; NIDDK NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R01 DK090989, R01DK090989]",,208,Apr-29,2016,352,6285,10.1126/science.aad9358,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Developmental signals are interpreted differently depending on the previous history of the responding cell. Thus, there is a context for the reception of a signal. While this conclusion is obvious during metamorphosis, when a single hormone instructs some cells to proliferate, some cells to differentiate, and other cells to die, it is commonplace during normal development. Paracrine factors such as BMP4 can induce apoptosis, proliferation, or differentiation depending upon the history of the responding cells. In addition, organisms have evolved to alter their development in response to differences in temperature, diet, the presence of predators, or the presence of competitors. This allows them to develop the phenotype, within the limits imposed by the genotype, best suited for the immediate habitat of the organism. Most developing organisms have also evolved to expect developmental signals from symbionts, and these organisms develop abnormally if the symbiont signals are not present. Thus Hoffmeyer's ""vertical semiotic system"" of genetic communication and ""horizontal semiotic system"" of ecological communication are integrated during development.","[Gilbert, Scott F.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Gilbert, Scott F.] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki, Finland",faculty research grant from Swarthmore College; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 145177],This paper was funded by a faculty research grant from Swarthmore College and by National Science Foundation Grant IOS 145177.,2,APR,2016,9,1,10.1007/s12304-016-9257-4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; History & Philosophy Of Science"

It has been shown that inoculation with pathogenic gut bacteria alters the behavior of mice; however, it is not known whether or not non-pathogenic resident microbes have similar effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the administration of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), a specific group of resident gut bacteria that generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S), impair learning and memory performance in mice tested in an 8-arm radial maze and Morris water maze. We found that mice spent more time in the center of the maze when they were gavaged with live SRB as compared to mice given saline (control), lactulose + mannitol (L/M), or killed SRB. SRB-gavaged mice were also tested using the Morris water maze and were found to take longer to complete the test, spend more time further from the platform, and have a longer path length to reach the platform. This effect of SRB on maze performance was associated with a higher concentration of H2S in the small intestine and cecum. We conclude that SRB, a specific resident gut bacterial species, could impair cognitive function in mice.

Microbiota do this directly and indirectly through their components, shed and secreted, ranging from fermented and digested dietary and host products to functionally active neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, and g-aminobutyric acid. Depression has been associated with enhanced levels of proinflammatory biomarkers and abnormal responses to stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be marked in addition by low cortisol responses, and these factors seem to predict and predispose individuals to develop PTSD after a traumatic event. Dysregulation of the immune system and of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis observed in PTSD may reflect prior trauma exposure, especially early in life. Early life, including the prenatal period, is a critical time in rodents, and may well be for humans, for the functional and structural development of the immune and nervous systems. These, in turn, are likely shaped and programmed by gut and possibly other bacteria. Recent experimental and clinical data converge on the hypothesis that imbalanced gut microbiota in early life may have long-lasting immune and other physiologic effects that make individuals more susceptible to develop PTSD after a traumatic event and contribute to the disorder. This suggests that it may be possible to target abnormalities in these systems by manipulation of certain gut bacterial communities directly through supplementation or indirectly by dietary and other novel approaches.","[Leclercq, Sophie; Forsythe, Paul; Bienenstock, John] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, McMaster Brain Body Inst, 50 Charlton Ave East, Hamilton, ON L8N 4A6, Canada; [Leclercq, Sophie; Bienenstock, John] McMaster Univ, Dept Pathol & Mol Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Forsythe, Paul] McMaster Univ, Firestone Inst Resp Hlth, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Forsythe, Paul] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada",US Office for Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-14-1-0787]; ONROffice of Naval Research,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge grant support from the US Office for Naval Research (ONR) (N00014-14-1-0787) and SL is a recipient of a post-doctoral fellowship from the ONR.",30,APR,2016,61,4,10.1177/0706743716635535,Psychiatry

A possible complication in these studies is that extracts might also contain DNA from the microbiome of the individual whose remains are being analysed and/or from environmental bacteria that have colonised the skeleton after death. These contaminants might include 'mycobacteria other than tuberculosis' (MOTT), which are common in the environment, but which are not normally associated with clinical cases of tuberculosis. In this paper we show that MOTT of various types, as well as bacteria of related genera, are present in most if not all archaeological remains. Our results emphasise the complications inherent in the biomolecular study of archaeological human tuberculosis. The specificity of any polymerase chain reaction directed at the MTBC cannot be assumed and, to confirm that an amplification is authentic, a sequencing strategy must be applied that allows characterisation of the PCR product. Any variations from the reference MTBC sequence must then be checked against sequence data for MOTT and other species to ensure that the product does actually derive from MTBC. Our results also illustrate the challenges faced when assembling MTBC genome sequences from ancient DNA samples, as misidentification of MOTT sequence reads as MTBC would lead to errors in the assembly. Identifying such errors would be particularly difficult, if not impossible, if the MOTT DNA content is greater than that of the authentic MTBC. The difficulty in identifying and excluding MOTT sequences is exacerbated by the fact that many MOTT are still uncharacterized and hence their sequence features are unknown. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Nutrition and policy science have advanced rapidly, creating confusion yet also providing powerful opportunities to reduce the adverse health and economic impacts of poor diets. This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non-genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases.","[Mozaffarian, Dariush] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA","National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health [R01 HL085710, R01 HL115189]","This work was supported by the National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01 HL085710, R01 HL115189), National Institutes of Health.",873,Jan-12,2016,133,2,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018585,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease

Disequilibria of cellular processes occurring in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract likely contribute to immune dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. As the venue of a complex community of resident microbes, the gut in a homeostatic state equates with a functional digestive system, cellular barrier stability and properly regulated recognition of self and non-self antigens. When gut processes become disrupted as a result of environmental or genetic factors, autoimmunity may ensue. Methods: Here, we review the issues pertinent to autoimmunity and the microbiome in psychiatric disorders and show that many of the reported immune risk factors for the development of these brain disorders are in fact related and consistent with dysfunctions occurring in the gut. We review the few human microbiome studies that have been done in people with psychiatric disorders and supplement this information with mechanistic data gleaned from experimental rodent studies. Results: These investigations demonstrate changes in behavior and brain biochemistry directly attributable to alterations in the gut microbiome. We present a model by which autoantigens are produced by extrinsically-derived food and microbial factors bound to intrinsic components of the gut including receptors present in the enteric nervous system. Conclusion: This new focus on examining activities outside of the CNS for relevance to the etiology and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders may require new modalities or a re-evaluation of pharmaceutical targets found in peripheral systems.","[Severance, Emily G.; Yolken, Robert H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanley Div Dev Neurovirol, 600 North Wolfe St,Blalock 1105, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Tveiten, Dag] Lab1, Leif Tronstads Pl, Sandvika, Norway; [Lindstrom, Lief H.] Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Neurosci Psychiat, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; [Reichelt, Karl L.] Univ Oslo, Kleve 4541, Oslo, Norway",NIMH P50 Silvio O.

Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature and summarized the major findings. Results: Alterations in the enteric ecosystem are believed to be due to a variety of factors including changes in the post-industrial society related to decreased exposure to symbiotic organisms, increased human migration, overuse of antibiotics and changes in dietary habits. Changes in the enteric ecosystem are believed to alter metabolic and immune system function and epigenetic regulation. If these changes occur during critical developmental windows, the trajectory of brain development, as well as brain function, can be altered. This paper reviews theoretical models that explain how these perturbations may in isolation or in combination be causative for ASDs as well as the preclinical and clinical studies that support these models. We discuss how these alterations may converge to trigger or exacerbate the formation of an ASD phenotype. We focus on possible preconception, prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors that may alter the enteric ecosystem leading to physiological disruptions, potentially through triggering events. Conclusion: If these theoretical models prove to be valid, they may lead to the development of practical interventions which could decrease ASD prevalence and/or morbidity.","[Slattery, John; Kahler, Stephen G.; Frye, Richard E.] Arkansas Childrens Res Inst, Little Rock, AR USA; [Slattery, John; Frye, Richard E.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Slattery, John; Frye, Richard E.] Univ Western Ontario, Kilee Patchell Evans Autism Res Grp, Dept Psychol Neurosci, London, ON, Canada; [MacFabe, Derrick F.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychiat, Div Dev Disabil, London, ON, Canada; [Kahler, Stephen G.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Div Genet & Metab, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA","Arkansas Biosciences Institute, Little Rock AR; Autism Research Institute, San Diego CA; Goodlife Children's Foundation","This work was supported in part by the Arkansas Biosciences Institute, Little Rock AR (REF), The Autism Research Institute, San Diego CA (REF, DFM) and Goodlife Children's Foundation (DFM).",10,,2016,22,40,10.2174/1381612822666160905123953,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Thus, there is a pressing need to identify novel targets for the development of new interventions and elucidate related biomarkers for the identification and monitoring of potentially responsive patients. In this sense, several hypotheses involving immune/inflammatory changes and the consequent oxidative/nitrosative stress, as well as a dysregulation in the immuno-inflammatory response have come into sight. Methods: Considering the great amount of genes encoded by the microbiome and the evidences pointing to the potential role of the gut microbiota on several neurologic and psychiatric diseases, the aim of this review is to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in the immunopathogenesis of schizophrenia. To that end, we will focus not only on gut microbiota dysbiosis but also on bacterial translocation as an inductor of neuroinflammation. Results: Studies have shown that the gut microbiota may play a key role in the immunopathogenesis of schizophrenia and that essential pathways implicated in the etiopathophysiology of schizophrenia are also regulated by the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Moreover, studies also indicate a possible role of the innate immunity through the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their activation by bacterial translocation, as a consequence of intestinal dysfunction, in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. Conclusion: This is a promising area of investigation with huge potential to offer advances in the realm of personalized medicine and accordingly, future research should examine several microbiota-targeted therapies in order to improve symptoms and to decrease the immune dysregulation seen in patients with schizophrenia.","[Caso, Javier R.; Garcia-Bueno, Borja] Univ Complutense Madrid, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Avda Complutense S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Caso, Javier R.; Garcia-Bueno, Borja] Inst Invest Sanitaria Hosp 12 Octubre Imas12, Madrid, Spain; [Caso, Javier R.; Palomo, Tomas] Univ Complutense Madrid, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Madrid, Spain; [Caso, Javier R.; Balanza-Martinez, Vicent; Palomo, Tomas; Garcia-Bueno, Borja] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain; [Balanza-Martinez, Vicent] La Fe Univ, Psychiat Serv, Valencia, Spain; [Balanza-Martinez, Vicent] Univ Valencia, Dept Med, Polytech Hosp, Valencia, Spain","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Spanish Ministry of Health (ISCIII)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIIMinistry of Health, Spain; Spanish Ministry of Health (CIBERSAM)Ministry of Health, Spain; Spanish Ministry of Health (FIS)Ministry of Health, Spain; Spanish Ministry of Health (Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Imas12); IUINQ; Autonomous Governments of Madrid (CannabCM); Foundation (Mutua Madrilena); Foundation (Alicia Koplowitz); CIBERSAM [SAM15PINT1514]; FISABIO (Spain) [UGP-14-184]","The authors' laboratories & research groups are supported by their home Institutions and Spanish Ministries of Economy and Competitiveness and Health (ISCIII, CIBERSAM, FIS, and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Imas12), IUINQ.

To know necro-waste is to examine the ways in which the dead human body is embedded in particular personal, social, historical, political, and environmental contexts. This study focuses on funerary practices in the US and Canada, where embalming has been routinely practiced. Viewing dead human bodies as materials processed by a robust funerary-industrial complex, I describe the processes by which the human body becomes separated into funeral products and funeral waste. I explain how funeral products themselves may be treated as waste, and I discuss varying attitudes toward the meaning and status of the human corpse. A waste-directed study of the human corpse is compatible with the symbolic dignity universally attributed to the dead human body. Yet, if the practices through which people honor the dead adversely affect the living (and not-yet living), then there is good reason to give careful, critical attention to the consequences of the ways in which the living show reverence for the dead.","[Olson, Philip R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Sci & Technol Soc, 333 Lane Hall 0247, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,,2,,2016,30,3,10.1080/02691728.2015.1015063,"History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"

The most prevalent hypothesis for AD is the amyloid hypothesis, which states that changes in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein leads to the accumulation of the amyloid beta (A beta) peptide. A beta then triggers an immune response that drives neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. The specific role of gut microbiota in modulating neuro-immune functions well beyond the gastrointestinal tract may constitute an important influence on the process of neurodegeneration. We first review the main mechanisms involved in AD physiopathology. Then, we review the alterations in gut microbiota and gut-brain axis that might be relevant to mediate or otherwise affect AD pathogenesis, especially those associated with aging. We finally summarize possible mechanisms that could mediate the involvement of gut-brain axis in AD physiopathology, and propose an integrative model.","[Kohler, Cristiano A.; Carvalho, Andre F.] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Clin Med, Fac Med, Rua Prof Costa Mendes 1608,4 Andar, BR-60430040 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Kohler, Cristiano A.; Carvalho, Andre F.] Univ Fed Ceara, Translat Psychiat Res Grp, Fac Med, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Maes, Michael; Berk, Michael] Deakin Univ, Sch Med, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Maes, Michael; Berk, Michael] Barwon Hlth, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Maes, Michael] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Maes, Michael] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Londrina, Brazil; [Maes, Michael] Med Univ Plovdiv, Dept Psychiat, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Maes, Michael] Revitalis, Waalre, Netherlands; [Slyepchenko, Anastasiya] St Josephs Healthcare, Womens Hlth Concerns Clin, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Slyepchenko, Anastasiya] McMaster Univ, MiNDS Program, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Orygen Natl Ctr Excellence Youth Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Orygen Youth Hlth Res Ctr, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Solmi, Marco] Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci, Padua, Italy; [Solmi, Marco] Dept Mental Hlth, Local Hlth Unit 17, Padua, Italy; [Solmi, Marco] IREM, Inst Clin Res & Educ Med, Padua, Italy; [Lanctot, Krista L.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Neuropsychopharmacol Res Grp, 2075 Bayview Ave,Suite FG-08, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq; Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES; Brazil)CAPES; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1059660],AFC is a recipient of a research fellowship award from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq; Brazil).

Nutrigenomics involves the study of interactions between the genome and diet, including how nutrients affect the transcription and translation process plus subsequent proteomic and metabolomic changes, and also differences in response to dietary factors based on the individual genetic makeup. Personalized characteristics such as age, gender, physical activity, physiological state and social status, and special conditions such as pregnancy and risk of disease can inform dietary advice that more closely meets individual needs. Precision nutrition has a promising future in treating the individual according to their phenotype and genetic characteristics, aimed at both the treatment and prevention of disease. However, many aspects are still in progress and remain as challenges for the future of nutrition. The integration of the human genotype and microbiome needs to be better understood. Further advances in data interpretation tools are also necessary, so that information obtained through newer tests and technologies can be properly transferred to consumers. Indeed, precision nutrition will integrate genetic data with phenotypical, social, cultural and personal preferences and lifestyles matters to provide a more individual nutrition, but considering public health perspectives, where ethical, legal and policy aspects need to be defined and implemented.

Objectives: The objectives of this review are to ( a) provide a brief overview of the microbiome and the ""microbiome-gut-brain axis""; (b) discuss factors known to affect the composition of the infant microbiome: mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure, and infant-feeding patterns; and (c) present research priorities for nursing science and clinical implications for infant health and neurocognitive development. Discussion: The gut microbiome influences immunological, endocrine, and neural pathways and plays an important role in infant development. Several factors influence colonization of the infant gut microbiome. Different microbial colonization patterns are associated with vaginal versus surgical birth, exposure to antibiotics, and infant-feeding patterns. Because of extensive physiological influence, infant microbial colonization patterns have the potential to impact physical and neurocognitive development and life course disease risk. Understanding these influences will inform newborn care and parental education.","[Yang, Irene; Corwin, Elizabeth J.; Jordan, Sheila; Murphy, Jordan R.; Dunlop, Anne] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, 1520 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Brennan, Patricia A.] Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Nursing ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R01NR014800]; National Institute of Nursing ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [T32NR01275]","The authors acknowledge that this work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Nursing Research (R01NR014800).; The project described was supported by Grant Number T32NR01275 (PI: S.

Bacteroides, an early member of the intestinal microbiome, is necessary for breaking down complex molecules within the intestine and function to assist the body's immune system in fighting against potentially harmful pathogens. Little is known about the colonization pattern of Bacteroides in preterm infants during the early neonatal period. Purpose: This study measured Bacteroides colonization during the early neonatal period in a population of preterm infants, based on clinical factors including mode of birth, antibiotics, and nutrition. Methods: Bacterial DNA was isolated from 144 fecal samples from 29 preterm infants and analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Analyses included liner mixed models to determine which clinical factors affect Bacteroides colonization of the infant gut. Results: We found that infants born via vaginal canal had a higher rate of increase in Bacteroides than infants born via cesarean section (P<.001). We did not find significant associations between antibiotic administration and differences in nutritional exposures with Bacteroides colonization. Implications for Practice: These findings highlight the significant influence of mode of birth on Bacteroides colonization. While mode of birth is not always modifiable, these study findings may help develop interventions for preterm infants born via cesarean section aimed at overcoming delayed Bacteroides colonization. Implications for Research: Greater study of the intestinal microbiome and the clinical factors relevant to the preterm infant is needed so that interventions may be developed and tested, resulting in optimal microbial and immune health.","[Gregory, Katherine E.; LaPlante, Rose D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pediat Newborn Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gregory, Katherine E.; LaPlante, Rose D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Nursing, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shan, Gururaj] Rowan Univ, Cooper Med Sch, Camden, NJ USA; [Kumar, Deepak Vijaya] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gregas, Matt] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",NINR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [K23 NR011320],,11,DEC,2015,15,6,10.1097/ANC.0000000000000237,Nursing

I highlight normal development, and the instructive-permissive distinction, as key parts of this framework which shape how variation is conceptualised and managed. Furthermore, I establish the different dimensions of biological variation: the units, temporality and mode of variation. Using the analytical frame established by this, I interpret a selection of examples as challenges to the instructive-permissive distinction. These examples include the phenomena of developmental plasticity and transdifferentiation, the role of the microbiome in development, and new methodological approaches to standardisation and the assessment of causes. Furthermore, I argue that investigations into organismal development should investigate the effects of a wider range of kinds of variation including variation in the units, modes and temporalities of development. I close by examining various possible opportunities for producing and using normal development free of the assumptions of the instructive-permissive distinction. These opportunities are afforded by recent developments, which include new ways of producing standards incorporating more natural variation and being based on function rather than structure, and the ability to produce, store, and process large quantities of data.","[Lowe, James W.

Due to increasing life expectancy and low birth rates, the incidence of age-related diseases is increasing in industrialized countries. Therefore, understanding the relationship between diseases and aging and facilitating healthy aging are major goals in medical research. In the last decades, the dimension of biological data has drastically increased with high-throughput technologies now measuring thousands of (epi) genetic, expression and metabolic variables. The most common and so far successful approach to the analysis of these data is the so-called reductionist approach. It consists of separately testing each variable for association with the phenotype of interest such as age or age-related disease. However, a large portion of the observed phenotypic variance remains unexplained and a comprehensive understanding of most complex phenotypes is lacking. Systems biology aims to integrate data from different experiments to gain an understanding of the system as a whole rather than focusing on individual factors. It thus allows deeper insights into the mechanisms of complex traits, which are caused by the joint influence of several, interacting changes in the biological system. In this review, we look at the current progress of applying omics technologies to identify biomarkers of aging. We then survey existing systems biology approaches that allow for an integration of different types of data and highlight the need for further developments in this area to improve epidemiologic investigations.","[Zierer, Jonas; Menni, Cristina; Kastenmueller, Gabi; Spector, Tim D.] Kings Coll London, Dept Twins Res & Genet Epidemiol, London SE1 7EH, England; [Zierer, Jonas; Kastenmueller, Gabi] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Neuherberg, Germany",EUEuropean Union (EU) [277849]; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Facility at Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London; National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [NF-SI-0514-10027],This work was supported by the EU Framework Programme 7 small-scale focused research collaborative project EurHEALTHAging [277849]; TwinsUK was funded by the Wellcome Trust; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013].

Increasing rates of obesity, coupled with the failure of many behavioural and pharmacological interventions, have contributed to a rise in popularity of bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity. Surgery-mediated weight loss was initially thought to be a direct result of mechanical alterations causing restriction and calorie malabsorption. However, the mounting evidence suggests that indirect factors influence the accumulation and storage of fat in patients that have undergone this procedure. Given the established impact the intestinal microbiota has on adiposity, it is likely that this complex enteric microbial community contributes to surgery-mediated weight loss and maintenance of weight loss postsurgery. In this review, we discuss the physiological and psychological traits exhibited by bariatric surgery candidates that can be influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Additionally, we detail the studies that investigated the impact of bariatric surgery on the intestinal microbiota in humans and mouse models of this procedure.

The wild tubers exploited by Hadza foragers in Tanzania are of interest because they are nontoxic, consumed raw or briefly roasted, and entail substantial physical barriers to consumers. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the biological value of Hadza tubers by measuring the absorption of glucose through in-vitro digestion. MethodsWe quantified digestibility using data from 24 experimental trials on four species of Hadza tuber using a dynamic in-vitro model that replicates digestion in the stomach and small intestine. Analysis of glucose in the input meal and output dialysate revealed the accessible glucose fraction. We also conducted assays for protein, vitamin, and mineral content on whole tubers and meal fractions. ResultsBioaccessibility of glucose varies depending on tuber species. Holding effects of chewing constant, brief roasting had negligible effects, but high intraspecific variation precludes interpretive power. Overall, Hadza tubers are very resistant to digestion, with between one- and two-thirds of glucose absorbed on average. Glucose absorption negatively correlated with glucose concentration of the tubers. ConclusionsRoasting may provide other benefits such as ease of peeling and chewing to extract edible parenchymatous tissue. A powerful factor in glucose acquisition is tuber quality, placing emphasis on the skill of the forager. Other nutrient assays yielded unexpectedly high values for protein, iron, and iodine, making tubers potentially valuable resources beyond caloric content. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:371-385, 2015.

Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate. Accordingly, treatment decisions may be informed by attention to questions of how (pathways) and for whom (predispositions) these links exist, which are the focus of this article. When combined with predisposing factors (moderators such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogens can lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, disturbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained inflammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promote intestinal permeability, another pathway to enhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symptom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a substantially greater impact on mood in individuals with heightened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating them in tandem may enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.","[Kiecolt-Glaser, Janice K.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Inst Behav Med Res, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Dispar Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CA172296, CA186720, CA186251]; Pelotonia Predoctoral Fellowship from the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center","Supported in part by NIH grants CA172296, CA186720, and CA186251 and a Pelotonia Predoctoral Fellowship from the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.",178,NOV,2015,172,11,10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15020152,Psychiatry

The mechanisms for these adverse events are poorly understood and, undoubtedly, multifactorial in etiology. In light of growing evidence implicating the gut microbiome in the host's energy regulation and in xenobiotic metabolism, we hypothesized that RSP treatment would be associated with changes in the gut microbiome in children and adolescents. Thus, the impact of chronic (>12 months) and short-term use of RSP on the gut microbiome of pediatric psychiatrically ill male participants was examined in a cross-sectional and prospective (up to 10 months) design, respectively. Chronic treatment with RSP was associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) and a significantly lower ratio of Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes as compared with antipsychotic-naive psychiatric controls (ratio = 0.15 vs 1.24, respectively; P < 0.05). Furthermore, a longitudinal observation, beginning shortly after onset of RSP treatment, revealed a gradual decrease in the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio over the ensuing months of treatment, in association with BMI gain. Lastly, metagenomic analyses were performed based on extrapolation from 16S ribosomal RNA data using the software package, Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). Those data indicate that gut microbiota dominating the RSP-treated participants are enriched for pathways that have been implicated in weight gain, such as short-chain fatty acid production.","[Bahr, S.

With these gains, recent concerns have focused on increases in neurodevelopment morbidity related to the interplay between stressful early life experiences and the immature neuroimmune systems. This interplay between these complex mechanisms is often described as the brain-gut signaling system. The role of the gut microbiome and the brain-gut signaling system have been found to be remarkably related to both short-and long-term stress and health. Recent evidence supports that microbial species, ligands, and/or products within the developing intestine play a key role in early programming of the central nervous system and regulation of the intestinal innate immunity. Purpose: The purpose of this state-of-the-science review is to explore the supporting evidence demonstrating the importance of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in regulation of early life experience. We also discuss the role of gut microbiome in modulating stress and pain responses in high-risk infants. A conceptual framework has been developed to illustrate the regulation mechanisms involved in early life experience. Conclusions: The science in this area is just beginning to be uncovered; having a fundamental understanding of these relationships will be important as new discoveries continue to change our thinking, leading potentially to changes in practice and targeted interventions.","[Cong, Xiaomei] Univ Connecticut, Sch Nursing, 231 Glenbrook Rd U4026, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Henderson, Wendy A.] NINR, Digest Disorder Unit, Biobehav Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Graf, Joerg] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [McGrath, Jacqueline M.] Univ Connecticut, Connecticut Childrens Med Ctr, Sch Nursing, Storrs, CT USA",National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [1K23NR014674-01],This publication was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number 1K23NR014674-01.,27,OCT,2015,15,5,10.1097/ANC.0000000000000191,Nursing

Data Sources: Electronic databases utilized to identify studies published in English included PubMed, Google Scholar, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and BioMedSearcher. Date of publication did not limit inclusion in the review. Study Selection: Two hundred fifty articles were assessed for relevance to the research question through title and abstract review. Further screening resulted in full review of 60 articles. An in-depth review of all 60 articles resulted in 39 articles that met inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight articles were eliminated on the basis of the type of study and subject of interest. Data Extraction: Studies were reviewed for information related to environmental factors that influence microbial colonization of the neonatal microbiome. Environment was later defined as the physical environment of the NICU and nursery caregiving activities. Data Synthesis: Studies were characterized into factors that impacted the infant's microbiome-parental skin, feeding type, environmental surfaces and caregiving equipment, health care provider skin, and antibiotic use. Conclusions: Literature revealed that various aspects of living within the NICU environment do influence the microbiome of infants. Caregivers can implement strategies to prevent environment-associated nosocomial infection in the NICU such as implementing infection control measures, encouraging use of breast milk, and decreasing the empirical use of antibiotics.","[Hartz, Lacey E.; Bradshaw, Wanda; Brandon, Debra H.] Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, Durham, NC USA; [Brandon, Debra H.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, DUMC 3322,307 Trent Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM108494],"The authors acknowledge that the preparation of this article was supported by the National Institute of Health, R01GM108494 (PI: P.

Fecal transplants involve the introduction of gut microbes from a healthy donor's stool to the patient and have been documented as effective for treating Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) and some other gastrointestinal disorders. However, the treatment has encountered regulatory hurdles preventing widespread uptake. We examined dominant representations of fecal transplants in Canadian media and found that fecal transplants are often represented as being inherently disgusting or distasteful (the ick factor). This ick factor is used to construct different messages about the treatment's social acceptability and legitimacy. We conclude that an over-emphasis on the ick factor constrains public discourse from a more nuanced discussion of the social challenges, scientific concerns, and regulatory issues surrounding the treatment.","[Chuong, Kim H.; O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Secko, David M.] Concordia Univ, Dept Journalism, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by a catalyst grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",6,OCT,2015,25,10,10.1177/1049732314568199,"Information Science & Library Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Social Sciences, Biomedical"

A query to a biomedical retrieval system often retrieves hundreds of results. Since the searcher will not likely consider all of these documents, ranking the documents is important. Ranking by recency, as PubMed does, takes into account only one factor indicating potential relevance. This study explores the use of the searcher's relevance feedback judgments to support relevance ranking based on features more general than recency. Results: It was found that the researcher's relevance judgments could be used to accurately predict the relevance of additional documents: both using tenfold cross-validation and by training on publications from 2008-2010 and testing on documents from 2011. Conclusions: This case study has shown the promise for relevance feedback to improve biomedical document retrieval. A researcher's judgments as to which initially retrieved documents are relevant, or not, can be leveraged to predict additional relevant documents.","[Thompson, Paul] Dartmouth Coll, Program Linguist, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Madan, Juliette C.] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Div Neonatol, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA; [Moore, Jason H.] Univ Penn, Inst Biomed Informat, Dept Genet, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Moore, Jason H.] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [LM009012, LM010098]","We acknowledge the computer programming assistance of Ryan Dundon, who wrote the code used in these experiments.

The microbiome can affect behavior through a number of neurobiological and immunological mechanisms. Most previous studies have focused on the bacterial components of the microbiome. However, the microbiome also includes viruses such as bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria and alter their metabolism and replication. We employed metagenomic analysis to characterize bacteriophage genomes in the oral pharynx of 41 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 control individuals without a psychiatric disorder. This analysis was performed by the generation of more than 100 000 000 sequence reads from each sample and the mapping of these reads to databases. We identified 79 distinct bacteriophage sequences in the oropharyngeal samples. Of these, one bacteriophage genome, Lactobacillus phage phiadh, was found to be significantly different in individuals with schizophrenia (P < .00037, q < 0.03 adjusted for multiple comparisons). The differential levels of Lactobacillus phage phiadh remained significant when controlling for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, or cigarette smoking (P < .006). Within the group of individuals with schizophrenia, the level of Lactobacillus phage phiadh correlated with the prevalence of immunological disorders as well as with the administration of valproate, which has been shown in animal models to alter the microbiome. The bacteriophage composition of the oropharynx in individuals with schizophrenia differs from that of controls. The biological consequences of this difference and the potential effects of altering bacteriophage levels through therapeutic interventions are worthy of further investigation.","[Yolken, Robert H.; Severance, Emily G.; Sabunciyan, Sarven; Gressitt, Kristin L.; Chen, Ou; Stallings, Cassie] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanley Lab Dev Neurovirol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Origoni, Andrea; Katsafanas, Emily; Schweinfurth, Lucy A.

In recent decades, the social representation of infant feeding moved in fact from the normality of breastfeeding to the normal use of artificial formulas and bottle-feeding. Even the scientific thinking and the research production have been influenced by this phenomenon. In fact, a clear dominance of studies aimed to show the benefits of breast milk compared to formula milk rather than the risks of the latter compared to the biological norm of breastfeeding. Mother milk affects infant health also through his/her microbiome. Microbial colonisation startes during intrauterine life and continues through the vaginal canal at birth, during skin to skin contact immediately after birth, with colostrum and breastfeeding. The microbial exposure of infants delivered by the mother influences the development of the child microbiota, by programming his/her future health. However, rewriting the biological normality implies also a health professional paradigm shift such as departing from the systematic separation-mother-child at birth, sticking at fixed schedules for breastfeeding time and duration, as it still happens in many birth centres. Breastfeeding has economic implications and the increase of its prevalence is associated with significant reduction of avoidable hospital admissions and medical care costs, both for the child and for the mother. Success in breastfeeding is the result of complex social interactions and not simply of an individual choice. However, any successful strategy must be oriented to the mother empowerment. Therefore, health professionals and community stakeholders have to learn and practice the health promotion approach, particularly avoiding prescribing appropriate breastfeeding behaviours to the mothers, but emphasizing her needs and preferences and her values system.","[Giusti, Angela] Ist Super Sanita, Ctr Nazl Epidemiol Sorveglianza & Promoz Salute, I-00161 Rome, Italy",,,3,SEP-DEC,2015,39,05-Jun,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

At present, the FDA is proposing to regulate FMT as a biologic drug. However, this proposed classification is both un-derregulatory and overregulatory. The FDA's primary goal is to ensure that patients have access to safe, effective treatments-and as such they should regulate some aspects of FMT more stringently than they propose to, and others less so. This essay will examine the nature of the regulatory challenges the FDA will face in deciding to regulate FMT as a biologic drug, and will then evaluate available policy alternatives for the FDA to pursue, ultimately concluding that the FDA ought to consider adopting a hybrid regulatory model as it has done in the case of cord blood.","[Sachs, Rachel E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Petrie Flom Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Edelstein, Carolyn A.] OpenBiome, Global Partnerships, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,,19,JUL,2015,2,2,10.1093/jlb/lsv032,"Ethics; Law; Medical Ethics; Medicine, Legal"

Accumulating evidence suggests exposures may alter the antenatal microbiome and subsequently alter the microbiome and health of offspring. Objectives The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize and critically evaluate the current state of knowledge regarding the assessment of the antenatal microbiome on the health of human offspring. The article provides a brief summary of the known factors affecting the human microbiome and studies that assessed relationships between the antenatal microbiome and health outcomes of the offspring. Methods An integrative review was conducted to examine human research studies that focused on the antenatal microbiome and the health of the offspring using the electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE and CINAHL from 2004 to the present. Results In addition to the known individual factors that are associated with establishment of the microbiome, the results of the integrative review suggest that medications (including antibiotics) and comorbidities (including infectious diseases, diet, socioeconomic status, and exposure to pollutants) should also be measured. Discussion The composition of the antenatal microbiome at various time points and body sites may be important mediators of short- and long-term health outcomes in offspring. In order to advance our understanding of the role of the antenatal microbiome on health and disease risk of the offspring, it will be important to further elucidate the composition of a healthy microbiome and specific mechanisms that contribute to altered health in later life.","[Wright, Michelle L.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Nursing, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Starkweather, Angela R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Nursing, Dept Adult Hlth & Nursing Syst, Richmond, VA 23298 USA",,,4,JUL-AUG,2015,64,4,10.1097/NNR.0000000000000101,Nursing

Risk factors for schizophrenia (inflammation, food intolerances, Toxoplasma gondii exposure, cellular barrier defects) are part of biological pathways that intersect those operant in the gut. Central to GI function is a homeostatic microbial community, and early reports show that it is disrupted in schizophrenia. Bioactive and toxic products derived from digestion and microbial dysbiosis activate adaptive and innate immunity. Complement Clq, a brain-active systemic immune component, interacts with gut-related schizophrenia risk factors in clinical and experimental animal models. With accumulating evidence supporting newly discovered gut brain physiological pathways, treatments to ameliorate brain symptoms of schizophrenia should be supplemented with therapies to correct GI dysfunction.","[Severance, Emily G.; Prandovszky, Emese; Yolken, Robert H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanley Div Dev Neurovirol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Castiglione, James] CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA",NIMH P50 Silvio O.

The evolutionary formation of a complex gut microbiota in mammals has played an important role in enabling brain development and perhaps sophisticated social interaction. Genes within the human gut microbiota, termed the microbiome, significantly outnumber human genes in the body, and are capable of producing a myriad of neuroactive compounds. Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system regulating behavior. Recent investigations indicate that these microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns, such as social interaction and stress management. In the absence of microbes, underlying neurochemistry is profoundly altered. Studies of gut microbes may play an important role in advancing understanding of disorders of cognitive functioning and social interaction, such as autism. (C), 2015 The Authors.

Surveys of healthy adults reveal that a signature composite of bacteria characterizes each unique body habitat (e.g., gut, skin, oral cavity, vagina). A myriad of clinical changes, including a basal proinflammatory state (inflamm-aging), that directly interface with the microbiota of older adults and enhance susceptibility to disease accompany aging. Studies in older adults demonstrate that the gut microbiota correlates with diet, location of residence (e.g., community dwelling, long-term care settings), and basal level of inflammation. Links exist between the microbiota and a variety of clinical problems plaguing older adults, including physical frailty, Clostridium difficile colitis, vulvovaginal atrophy, colorectal carcinoma, and atherosclerotic disease.

Evidence is accumulating that the gut microbiota (GM) influences behavior through modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and hence, part of the variation within this animal model may derive from variation in the GM. The aims of this study was to investigate first, the duration of subPCP-induced cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test, and second, the possible effect of subchronic PCP-treatment on the GM, and the association between the GM and the behavioral parameters. The association was further investigated by antibiotic reduction of the GM. Male Lister Hooded rats were dosed twice daily i.p. with either 5 mg/kg PCP or sterile isotonic saline for seven days followed by a seven-day washout period. Rats were tested in the novel object recognition and the locomotor activity assays immediately after, three weeks after, or six weeks after washout, and the fecal GM was analyzed by high throughput sequencing. Antibiotic- and control-treated rats were tested in the same manner following washout In conclusion, subPCP-treatment impaired novel object recognition up to three weeks after washout, whereas locomotor sensitivity was increased for at least six weeks after washout Differences in the core gut microbiome immediately after washout suggested subPCP treatment to alter the GM. GM profiles correlated to memory performance. Administration of ampicillin abolished the subPCP-induced memory deficit. It thus seems reasonable to speculate that the GM influences memory performance, contributing to variation within the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Jorgensen, B.

A combination of soft starchy foods, changing acidity of the oral environment, genetic predisposition, and the absence of dental hygiene all lead to the build-up of microorganisms and food debris on the tooth crown, which eventually calcifies through a complex process of mineralisation. Millions of oral microbes are trapped and preserved within this mineralised matrix, including pathogens associated with the oral cavity and airways, masticated food debris, and other types of extraneous particles that enter the mouth. As a result, archaeologists and anthropologists are increasingly using ancient human dental calculus to explore broad aspects of past human diet and health. Most recently, high-throughput DNA sequencing of ancient dental calculus has provided valuable insights into the evolution of the oral microbiome and shed new light on the impacts of some of the major biocultural transitions on human health throughout history and prehistory. Here, we provide a brief historical overview of archaeological dental calculus research, and discuss the current approaches to ancient DNA sampling and sequencing. Novel applications of ancient DNA from dental calculus are discussed, highlighting the considerable scope of this new research field for evolutionary biology and modern medicine.

As a result of its complexity and direct contact with ingested alcohol, the intestine represents the primary source from which alcohol-associated pathologies stem. The gut is the largest reservoir of bacteria in the body, and under healthy conditions, it maintains a barrier preventing bacteria from translocating out of the intestinal lumen. The intestinal barrier is compromised following alcohol exposure, which can lead to life-threatening systemic complications including sepsis and multiple organ failure. Furthermore, alcohol is a major confounding factor in pathology associated with trauma. Experimental data from both human and animal studies suggest that alcohol perturbs the intestinal barrier and its function, which is exacerbated by a ""second hit"" from traumatic injury. This article highlights the role of alcohol-mediated alterations of the intestinal epithelia and its defense against bacteria within the gut, and the impact of alcohol on intestinal immunity, specifically on T cells and neutrophils. Finally, it discusses how the gut microbiome both contributes to and protects the intestines from dysbiosis after alcohol exposure and trauma.","[Hammer, Adam M.; Morris, Niya L.; Earley, Zachary M.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Alcohol Res Program, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Hammer, Adam M.; Morris, Niya L.; Earley, Zachary M.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Burn & Shock Trauma Res Inst, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Hammer, Adam M.; Morris, Niya L.; Earley, Zachary M.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Program Integrat Cellular Biol, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Choudhry, Mashkoor A.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Dept Surg, Stritch Sch Med, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Choudhry, Mashkoor A.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Dept Microbiol, Stritch Sch Med, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Choudhry, Mashkoor A.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Dept Immunol, Stritch Sch Med, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Choudhry, Mashkoor A.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Alcohol Res Program, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Choudhry, Mashkoor A.] Loyola Univ, Chicago Hlth Sci Div, Burn & Shock Trauma Res Inst, Maywood, IL 60153 USA","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-AA-015731, R01-AA-015731-08S1, T32-AA-013527]; Dr. Ralph and Marian C.

Alcohol-induced changes in the GIT microbiota composition and metabolic function may contribute to the well-established link between alcohol-induced oxidative stress, intestinal hyperpermeability to luminal bacterial products, and the subsequent development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), as well as other diseases. In addition, clinical and preclinical data suggest that alcohol-related disorders are associated with quantitative and qualitative dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiota and may be associated with increased GIT inflammation, intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and tissue damage/organ pathologies including ALD.

This review provides evidence for the gut microbiota as a key factor mediating the link between diet and depressive illness.Recent findingsThe development of new technologies is affording a better understanding of how diet influences gut microbiota composition and activity and how this may, in turn, influence depressive illness. New interventions are also suggesting the possible utility of pre and probiotic formulations and fermented food in influencing mental health.SummaryAlthough in its early stages, the emerging field of research focused on the human microbiome suggests an important role for the gut microbiota in influencing brain development, behaviour and mood in humans. The recognition that the gut microbiota interacts bidirectionally with other environmental risk factors, such as diet and stress, suggests promise in the development of interventions targeting the gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of common mental health disorders.","[Dash, Sarah; Berk, Michael; Jacka, Felice N.] Deakin Univ, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Clarke, Gerard] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Psychiat, Cork, Ireland; [Clarke, Gerard] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Alimentary Pharmabiot Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Berk, Michael; Jacka, Felice N.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Orygen Youth Hlth Res Ctr, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice N.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Adolescent Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacka, Felice N.] Black Dog Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia",NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1059660]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland [SFI/12/RC/2273]; NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research FoundationNARSAD [20771]; Deakin University,M.B. is supported by an NHMRC Senior Principal Research Fellowship 1059660.

These observations are generally consistent with a hypothesis that posits a difference in trophic level between the nursing infant and the mother; however, using these data to reconstruct weaning ages is problematic. The assumptions used to determine age of weaning are reviewed; uncertainty in the isotopic trophic offsets, high scatter due to low sample numbers, errors in the age determination of infants, and how representative the samples are for the whole population are possible contributors to uncertainty in determining weaning times from archaeological bones. Other possible explanations for these age-related isotopic differences have generally not been considered in the archaeological literature. Factors bearing further investigation are the possibility of developmental (nondietary) differences in tissue isotopic composition, incorporation of non-protein nitrogen in milk and the effects of the gut microbiome.

The emergent field of microbiome science brought together diverse disciplinary perspectives and technologies, thus facilitating the negotiation of differing values. Here, we describe how values are conceptualized and negotiated within microbiome research. Analyzing discussions from a series of interdisciplinary workshops conducted with microbiome researchers, we argue that negotiations of epistemic, social, and institutional values were inextricable from the reflective and strategic category work (i.e., the work of anticipating and strategizing around divergent sets of institutional categories) that defined and organized the microbiome as an object of study and a potential future site of biomedical intervention. Negotiating the divergence or tension between emerging scientific and regulatory classifications also activated values levers and opened up reflective discussions of how classifications embody values and how these values might differ across domains. These data suggest that scholars at the intersections of science and technology studies, ethics, and policy could leverage such openings to identify and intervene in the ways that ethical/regulatory and scientific/technical practices are coproduced within unfolding research.","[Darling, Katherine W.] UCSF, Dept Social & Behav Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Boyce, Angie M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Ithaca, NY USA; [Cho, Mildred K.] Stanford Ctr Biomed Eth, Stanford, CA USA; [Sankar, Pamela L.] Univ Penn, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,5,JAN,2015,40,1,10.1177/0162243914545405,Social Issues

Although primate field studies tend to focus on shifts in activity and diet as mechanisms to compensate for these demands, differences in digestive efficiency also are likely to be important. Because the gut microbiota can impact host digestive efficiency, we examined differences in activity budget, diet, and the gut microbial community among adult male (N=4), adult female (N=4), and juvenile (N=5) wild black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) across a ten-month period in Palenque National Park, Mexico to determine how adult females and juveniles compensate for increased nutritional demands. Results indicate that adult females and juveniles consumed more protein and energy than adult males. Adult males, adult females, and juveniles also possessed distinct gut microbial communities, unrelated to diet. Juveniles exhibited a gut microbiota characterized by bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes, such as Roseburia and Ruminococcus, and demonstrated high fecal volatile fatty acid content, suggesting increased microbial contributions to host energy balances. Adult females possessed a higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, also suggesting increased energy production, and their gut microbiota was characterized by Lactococcus, which has been associated with folate biosynthesis. On the basis of these patterns, it appears that the gut microbiota differentially contributes to howler monkey nutrition during reproduction and growth. Determining the nutritional and energetic importance of shifts in activity, diet, and the gut microbiota in other nonhuman primate taxa, as well as humans, will transform our understanding of these life history processes and the role of host-microbe relationships in primate evolution.

It is important to understand whether these factors are associated with non-participation or attrition of participants from longitudinal studies in order to examine potential for recruitment or attrition bias. We describe factors associated with participation and attrition in a 24-month prospective cohort study, investigating incident BV among Australian women who have sex with women. Study Design and Setting: Participants negative for prevalent BV were offered enrolment in a longitudinal cohort study. Participants self-collected vaginal samples and completed questionnaires 3-monthly to endpoint (BV-positive/BV-negative by 24 months). Factors associated with participation in the cohort study were examined by logistic regression and factors associated with attrition from the cohort were examined by Cox regression. Results: The cross-sectional study recruited 457 women. 334 BV-negative women were eligible for the cohort and 298 (89%, 95%CI 85, 92) enrolled. Lower educational levels (aOR 2.72, 95%CI 1.09, 6.83), smoking (aOR 2.44, 95%CI 1.13, 5.27), past BV symptoms (aOR 3.42, 95%CI 1.16, 10.10) and prior genital warts (aOR 2.71, 95%CI 1.14, 6.46) were associated with non-participation; a partner co-enrolling increased participation (aOR 3.73, 95%CI 1.43, 9.70). 248 participants (83%, 95%CI 78, 87) were retained to study endpoint (BV-negative at 24 months or BV-positive at any stage). Attrition was associated being <30 yrs (aHR 2.15, 95%CI 1.13, 4.10) and a male partner at enrolment (aHR 6.12, 95%CI 1.99, 18.82). Conclusion: We achieved high participation and retention levels in a prospective cohort study and report factors influencing participation and retention of participants over a 24-month study period, which will assist in the design and implementation of future cohort studies in sexual health and disease.","[Forcey, Dana S.; Walker, Sandra M.; Vodstrcil, Lenka A.; Fairley, Christopher K.; Bilardi, Jade E.; Fethers, Katherine A.; Petersen, Susan; Bellhouse, Clare; Chen, Marcus Y.; Bradshaw, Catriona S.] Alfred Hlth, Melbourne Sexual Hlth Ctr, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Forcey, Dana S.; Walker, Sandra M.; Vodstrcil, Lenka A.; Hocking, Jane S.; Bradshaw, Catriona S.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Fairley, Christopher K.; Bilardi, Jade E.; Chen, Marcus Y.; Bradshaw, Catriona S.] Monash Univ, Alfred Ctr, Cent Clin Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Law, Matthew] Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia",Australian National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP57431]; Early Careers Fellowship [ERC1013135]; Lesbian Health Research Grant from the Australian Lesbian Medical Association; AIDS Council of New South Wales,"This work was supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (program grant APP57431) and Early Careers Fellowship grant ERC1013135 to J.E.B.

Microbiome research has emphasized the potential role of this ecosystem in human homeostasis, offering unexpected opportunities in therapeutics, far beyond digestive diseases. It has also highlighted ethical, social and commercial concerns related to the gut microbiota. As diet factors are accepted to be the major regulator of the gut microbiota, the modulation of its composition, either by antibiotics or by food intake, should be regarded as a fascinating tool for improving the human health. Scientists, the food industry, consumers and policymakers alike are involved in this new field of nutrition. Defining how knowledge about the HGM is being translated into public perception has never been addressed before. This raises the question of metaphors associated with the HGM, and how they could be used to improve public understanding, and to influence individual decision-making on healthcare policy.

Early 21st century bioarchaeology may also be enhanced from a renewed engagement with the concept of biological stress. New insights on biological stress and disease can be gained from cross-disciplinary perspectives regarding human skeletal variation and disease. First, pathophysiologic and molecular signaling mechanisms can provide more precise understandings regarding formation of pathological phenotypes in bone. Using periosteal new bone formation as an example, various mechanisms and pathways are explored in which new bone can be formed under conditions of biological stress, particularly in bone microenvironments that involve inflammatory changes. Second, insights from human biology are examined regarding some epigenetic factors and disease etiology. While epigenetic effects on stress and disease outcomes appear profoundly influential, they are mostly invisible in skeletal tissue. However, some indirect and downstream effects, such as the developmental origins of adult health outcomes, may be partially observable in bioarchaeological data. Emerging perspectives from the human microbiome are also considered. Microbiomics involves a remarkable potential to understand ancient biology, disease, and stress. Third, tools from epidemiology are examined that may aid bioarchaeologists to better cope with some of the inherent limitations of skeletal samples to better measure and quantify the expressions of skeletal stress markers. Such cross-disciplinary synergisms hopefully will promote more complete understandings of health and stress in bioarchaeological science.

It is argued that in comparison with heterosexuals, high-risk MSM (hrMSM) have a higher prevalence of oro-penile, oro-rectal and anal sex which facilitates an enhanced mixing of the pharyngeal, rectal and penile microbiomes. In addition, hrMSM have an increased number of sexual partners per unit time and an increased prevalence of sexual relationships overlapping in time. The increased flux of microbiomes between different body habitats between sexual partners, in combination with the increased connectivity of the sexual network, serve to create a novel high-risk MSM sexual ecosystem with important consequences for the genesis and spread of antibiotic resistance.

This is reflected in the robust finding in many studies that the proportions and numbers of naive B and T cells are lower and memory cells higher in the elderly. In addition to the ""extrinsic"" effects of pathogen exposure, ""intrinsic"" events such as age-associated differences in haematopoeitic stem cells and their niches in the bone marrow associated with differences in cell maturation and output to the periphery are also observed. In the case of T cells, the ""intrinsic"" process of thymic involution, beginning before puberty, further contributes to reducing the production of naive T cells. Like memory T cell populations, innate immune cells may be increased in number but decreased in efficacy on a per-cell basis. Thus, superimposed on chronological age alone, remodelling of immunity as a result of interactions with the environment over the life course is instrumental in shaping immune status in later life. In addition to interactions with pathogens, host microbiome and nutrition, exercise and stress, and many other extrinsic factors are crucial modulators of this ""immunosenescence"" process. In this review, we briefly outline the observed immune differences between younger and older people, and discuss the possible impacts of behavioral variations thereon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Until now, biochar soil amendment has been reported to affect the progress of diseases caused by soilborne plant pathogens in six distinct pathosystems. Disease severity frequently exhibits a U-shaped response curve, with a minimum at some intermediate biochar dose. Alteration of plant disease intensity by biochar added to soil may result from its varied influences on the soil rhizosphere pathogen plant system. These influences may involve myriad biochar properties such as nutrient content, water holding capacity, redox activity, adsorption ability, pH and content of toxic or hormone-like compounds. The direct and indirect impacts of biochar on the soil environment, host plant, pathogen and the rhizosphere microbiome can have domino effects on both plant development and disease progress.","[Graber, E.

A hypothesis is presented wherein the root cause of OCD is proposed to be a dysfunction of the gut microbiome constituency resulting in a susceptibility to obsessional thinking. Both stress and antibiotics are proposed as mechanisms by which gut microbiota are altered preceding the onset of OCD symptomology. In this light, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) leading to episodic OCD is explained not by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, but rather by prophylactic antibiotics that are administered as treatment. Further, stressful life events known to trigger OCD, such as pregnancy, are recast to show the possibility of altering gut microbiota prior to onset of OCD symptoms. Suggested treatment for OCD would be the directed, specie-specific (re)introduction of beneficial bacteria modifying the gut microbiome, thereby ameliorating OCD symptoms. Special considerations should be contemplated when considering efficacy of treatment, particularly the unhealthy coping strategies often observed in patients with chronic OCD that may need addressing in conjunction with microbiome remediation.

There is no doubting that the natural world provides mankind with the majority of the resources required to sustain life and health. Many species provide food, fuel, medicines; with the potential for many more (as of yet) undiscovered uses for various species. Despite this, there have been very few attempts to actually investigate relationships between biodiversity (i.e. number of species, rather than the ability of specific species to provide health benefits) and human health. This paper reviews the available evidence and demonstrates that while the links between biodiversity and health seem intuitive, they are very difficult to prove. Socio-economics has a huge influence on health status and the exploitation of natural resources (leading to eventual biodiversity loss) tends to have a positive economic effects. More direct effects of biodiversity on health include the diversity of the internal microbiome, the effect of natural diversity on our mental health and well-being (although this has large social aspects with many people feeling fearful in very diverse environments). Still to be elucidated are the tipping points where the level of global biodiversity loss is such that human health can no longer be sustained.","James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland",Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS),"This work was funded by Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) under their Strategic Programme on Environmental Change: Ecosystem Services; Theme 1: Scotland's environmental assets, biodiversity and ecosystem services are identified and valued to inform decision making.",28,FEB,2014,23,2,10.1007/s10531-013-0614-1,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences

The basic concepts and research approaches have changed considerably during the last 50 years, but still show a clear convergence. The gastrointestinal tract reacts to different stressors with different motility patterns; different sections of the gastrointestinal tract can hereby react in different, sometimes opposing ways. There are hints, though no clear-cut evidence, in favor of the notion that different emotions are associated with different reaction patterns. In contrast to the original assumption, there is no clear relationship between the motility patterns and the various kinds of gastrointestinal discomfort. The irritable bowel syndrome, as the functional gastrointestinal disorder with the highest clinical significance, is associated with intestinal hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity, and hypervigilance. This is directly related to the processing of stimuli in the central nervous system: In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal pain stimuli lead to increased activation of nuclear areas related to pain perception and stress processing. It has also been shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and especially the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF1) receptors are involved in visceral hyperalgesia. In contrast to earlier assumptions, immunological processes are involved in the irritable bowel syndrome as well, and these processes are also dependent on psychological factors. Stress affects the immunological reactions via diverse pathways. These inflammatory processes originate from struggling with the bacterial colonization of the intestine, and especially of the colon. Stress influences the qualitative and quantitative composition of our 'microbiome', and the microbiome composition in turn modulates the stress response. Obviously, a full understanding of the functional gastrointestinal disorders also requires consideration of the microbiome and its related immunological processes.","Schon Klin Roseneck, D-83209 Prien Am Chiemsee, Germany",,,0,,2014,24,2,10.1159/000362913,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry"

Interactions between primate hosts and these microbes profoundly affect primate physiology, reproduction, health, survival, and ultimately, evolution. It is increasingly clear that primate health cannot be understood fully without knowledge of host-microbial interactions. Our goals here are to review what is known about microbiomes of the female reproductive tract and to explore several factors that influence variation within individuals, as well as within and between primate species. Much of our knowledge of microbial variation derives from studies of humans, and from microbes located in nonreproductive regions (e.g., the gut). We review work suggesting that the vaginal microbiota affects female health, fecundity, and pregnancy outcomes, demonstrating the selective potential for these agents. We explore the factors that correlate with microbial variation within species. Initial colonization by microbes depends on the manner of birth; most microbial variation is structured by estrogen levels that change with age (i.e., at puberty and menopause) and through the menstrual cycle. Microbial communities vary by location within the vagina and can depend on the sampling methods used (e.g., swab, lavage, or pap smear). Interindividual differences also exist, and while this variation is not completely understood, evidence points more to differences in estrogen levels, rather than differences in external physical environment. When comparing across species, reproductive-age humans show distinct microbial communities, generally dominated by Lactobacillus, unlike other primates. We develop evolutionary hypotheses to explain the marked differences in microbial communities. While much remains to be done to test these hypotheses, we argue that the ample variation in primate mating and reproductive behavior offers excellent opportunities to evaluate host-microbe coevolution and adaptation.

Scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture, as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens. Here, we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins, analyzing these data using the epidemiological transition framework. Genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged; it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted. We also consider the broader effect of agriculture upon the microbiome, exploring potential consequences for human health.

Dietary fiber has multiple health benefits. It remains unclear whether fiber intake is independently linked to superior physical performance. We aimed to assess the association between dietary fiber and physical performance in older adults. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with community-dwelling adults aged 55 years and older (n=2680) from the ongoing Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study (HALST) in Taiwan 2008-2010. Daily dietary fiber intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Physical performance was determined objectively by measuring gait speed, 6-minute walk distance, timed ""up and go"" (TUG), summary performance score, hand grip strength. Results: Adjusting for all potential confounders, participants with higher fiber intake had significantly faster gait speed, longer 6-minute walk distance, faster TUG, higher summary performance score, and higher hand grip strength (all P<.05). Comparing with the highest quartile of fiber intake, the lowest quartile of fiber intake was significantly associated with the lowest sex-specific quartile of gait speed (adjusted OR, 2.18 in men [95% CI, 1.33-3.55] and 3.65 in women [95% CI, 2.20-6.05]), 6-minute walk distance (OR, 2.40 in men [95% CI, 1.38-4.17] and 4.32 in women [95% CI, 2.37-7.89]), TUG (OR, 2.42 in men [95% CI, 1.43-4.12] and 3.27 in women [95% CI, 1.94-5.52]), summary performance score (OR, 2.12 in men [95% CI, 1.19-3.78] and 5.47 in women [95% CI, 3.20-9.35]), and hand grip strength (OR, 2.64 in men [95% CI, 1.61-4.32] and 4.43 in women [95% CI, 2.62-7.50]).

After applying the exclusion criteria, the search produced 107 articles. Results: The association of PSP with PTB varied according to the dimensions and timing of PSP. Stronger associations were generally found in early pregnancy, and most studies demonstrating positive results found moderate effect sizes, with risk ratios between 1.2 and 2.1. Subjective perception of stress and pregnancy-related anxiety appeared to be the stress measures most closely associated with PTB. Potential physiological pathways identified included behavioral, infectious, neuroinflammatory, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. Conclusions: Future research should examine the biological pathways of these different psychosocial stress dimensions and at multiple time points across pregnancy. Culture-independent characterization of the vaginal microbiome and noninvasive monitoring of cholinergic activity represent two exciting frontiers in this research.","[Shapiro, Gabriel D.] Univ Montreal, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Shapiro, Gabriel D.; Fraser, William D.; Frasch, Martin G.; Seguin, Jean R.] Univ Montreal, CHU St Justine, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; [Fraser, William D.; Frasch, Martin G.] Univ Montreal, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; [Seguin, Jean R.] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",CIHR training grantCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Sainte-Justine UHC Foundation training grant; CIHR Canada Research ChairCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); CIHR operating grantCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); FRSQ salary award,"This work was supported via a CIHR training grant and a Sainte-Justine UHC Foundation training grant to G.D.S., a CIHR Canada Research Chair (Tier II) to W.D.F., and a CIHR operating grant and FRSQ salary award to M.G.F.",78,NOV,2013,41,6,10.1515/jpm-2012-0295,Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics

The translocation of commensal microbiota across the gastrointestinal barrier can result in a persistent state of low-grade immune activation and/or inflammation. We measured serological surrogate markers of bacterial translocation (soluble CD14 (sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)) in two psychiatric cohorts and compared these levels to C-reactive protein (CRP), body mass index (BMI), and food-related and autoimmune antibodies. The two cohorts were composed of the following: (1) n = 141 schizophrenia, n = 75 bipolar disorder, n = 78 controls; (2) n = 78 antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia, n = 38 medicated first-episode schizophrenia. sCD14 seropositivity conferred a 3.1-fold increased odds of association with schizophrenia (multivariate regressions, OR = 3.09, p < 0.0001) compared to controls. Case-control differences in sCD14 were not matched by LBP. Quantitative levels of LBP, but not sCD14, correlated with BMI in schizophrenia (R-2 = 0.21, p < 0.0001). sCD14 and LBP also exhibited some congruency in schizophrenia with both significantly correlated with CRP (R-2 = 0.26-0.27, p < 0.0001) and elevated in females compared to males (p < 0.01). Antipsychotic treatment generally did not impact sCD14 or LBP levels except for significant correlations, especially sCD14, with gluten antibodies in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia (R-2 = 0.27, p < 0.0001). In bipolar disorder, sCD14 levels were significantly correlated with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgG (R-2 = 0.37, p < 0.001). In conclusion, these bacterial translocation markers produced discordant and complex patterns of activity, a finding that may reflect an imbalanced, activated innate immune state. Whereas both markers may upregulate following systemic exposure to Gram-negative bacteria, non-lipopolysaccharide-based monocyte activation, autoimmunity and metabolic dysfunction may also contribute to the observed marker profiles.

Recent findings Some studies link exposure to infectious agents to development of brain disorders; others have identified autoantibodies in individuals with these conditions without finding evidence of pathogens. Neither line of work demonstrates consistent associations between a specific neuropsychiatric disease and a particular environmental trigger or immune marker. Growing evidence suggests that the microbiome conditions host immunity to microbes and xenobiotics, and regulates autoimmune responses that can affect the central nervous system (CNS). The presence of CNS receptors for cytokines and other immune molecules underscores the importance of brain-immune crosstalk in maintaining normal function. An increased prevalence of familial autoimmunity, exposure to pathogens prenatally and postnatally, and findings of antibrain antibodies is common in disorders as diverse as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism, and suggests that differences in exposure timing and genetic vulnerability toward autoimmunity are important determinants of neuropsychiatric outcomes. Summary Microbes, both pathogenic and commensal, can induce autoantibodies that bind to brain and affect behavior in susceptible hosts. Interventions that correct the microbial balance or diminish autoantibody binding may be effective in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions mediated by autoimmunity.","[Hornig, Mady] Columbia Univ, Ctr Infect & Immun, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,84,JUL,2013,25,4,10.1097/BOR.0b013e32836208de,Rheumatology

Among the reasons for this high mortality are some common rearing practices. In this review, we point out several commonly used management practices, which neither represent adequate housing conditions according to the animals' behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs. Sometimes, the doe has to build the nursery nest on the cage floor or in a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the light. This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed behaviour of the mother such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the kits outside the nest, or infanticide. Furthermore, continuous housing of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species' pattern of unusually limited maternal care. Possibly stimulated by olfactory and acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe can disturb the inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive maternal behaviour under such conditions can also contribute to increased mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. In addition, when the doe is left to nurse the kits longer than four weeks, which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit morbidity can be increased by the following factors. Although the doe's milk has a high protective role against main digestive disorders, prolonged mother-offspring contact might increase the risk of the kits becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. Pre-disposition of the kits to bacterial enteropathies can be encouraged by the delayed development of the enzymatic system, the delayed establishment of a stable gut flora, as well as by consumption of the doe's feed. The increased energy demands of lactation as well as mastitis incidence due to prolonged suckling by the kits could decrease the fertility and the lifespan of the doe. Feed with a high content of non-fibre carbohydrates (compared to green forage) can promote bacterial enteropathies when given before the development of the kits' digestive functions is completed. The risk of the outbreak of such diseases is enhanced by intestinal coccidiosis and unstable gut flora. Enteropathies are also exacerbated by the use of deep litter as opposed to housing rabbits on perforated floors.","[Hudson, R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Biomed, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Roedel, H.

Ongoing advances in sequencing technology and computational methods have enabled the collection and analysis of vast amounts of molecular data from diverse biological communities. While early studies focused on cataloguing microbial biodiversity in environments ranging from simple marine ecosystems to complex soil ecologies, more recent research is concerned with community functions and their dynamics over time. Models and concepts from traditional ecology have been used to generate new insight into microbial communities, and novel system-level models developed to explain and predict microbial interactions. The process of moving from molecular inventories to functional understanding is complex and challenging, and never more so than when many thousands of dynamic interactions are the phenomena of interest. We outline the process of how epistemic transitions are made from producing catalogues of molecules to achieving functional and predictive insight, and show how those insights not only revolutionize what is known about biological systems but also about how to do biology itself. Examples will be drawn primarily from analyses of different human microbiota, which are the microbial consortia found in and on areas of the human body, and their associated microbiomes (the genes of those communities). Molecular knowledge of these microbiomes is transforming microbiological knowledge, as well as broader aspects of human biology, health and disease.","[McDonald, Daniel; Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McDonald, Daniel; Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, BioFrontiers Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Vazquez-Baeza, Yoshiki; Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Walters, William A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Caporaso, J.

Drawing from a larger qualitative study on ethical, legal and social dimensions of human microbiome research, in this article, we document perspectives related to the translation of human microbiome research into clinical practice, focusing particularly on implications for health, illness and disease. Methods: We conducted 60 in-depth, semi-structured interviews (2009-2010) with 63 researchers and National Institutes of Health project leaders ('investigators') involved with human microbiome research. The interviews explored a range of ethical, legal and social implications of human microbiome research, including investigators' perspectives on potential strategies for translating findings to clinical practice. Using thematic content analysis, we identified and analyzed emergent themes and patterns. Results: We identified 3 themes: (1) investigators' general perspectives on the clinical utility of human microbiome research, (2) investigators' perspectives on antibiotic use, overuse and misuse, and (3) investigators' perspectives concerning future challenges of translating data to clinical practice. Conclusion: The issues discussed by investigators concerning the clinical significance of human microbiome research, including embracing a new paradigm of health and disease, the importance of microbial communities, and clinical utility, will be of critical importance as this research moves forward.

Physical function declines, and markers of inflammation increase with advancing age, even in healthy persons. Microbial translocation (MT) is the systemic exposure to mucosal surface microbes/microbial products without overt bacteremia and has been described in a number of pathologic conditions. We hypothesized that markers of MT, soluble CD14 (sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), may be a source of chronic inflammation in older persons and be associated with poorer physical function. Methods. We assessed cross-sectional relationships among two plasma biomarkers of MT (sCD14 and LBP), physical function (hand grip strength, short physical performance battery [SPPB], gait speed, walking distance, and disability questionnaire), and biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-alpha soluble receptor 1 [TNFsR1]) in 59 older (60-89 years), healthy (no evidence of acute or chronic illness) men and women. Results. LBP was inversely correlated with SPPB score and grip strength (p = .02 and p < .01, respectively) and positively correlated with CRP (p = 0.04) after adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index. sCD14 correlated with IL-6 (p = .01), TNF-alpha (p = .05), and TNFsR1 (p < .0001). Furthermore, the correlations between LBP and SPPB and grip strength remained significant after adjusting for each inflammatory biomarker. Conclusions. In healthy older individuals, LBP, a surrogate marker of MT, is associated with worse physical function and inflammation. Additional study is needed to determine whether MT is a marker for or a cause of inflammation and the associated functional impairments.","[Stehle, John R., Jr.; Nicklas, Barbara J.; Kritchevsky, Stephen B.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Sect Gerontol & Geriatr Med, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Leng, Xiaoyan] Wake Forest Sch Med, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Dept Biostat Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Kitzman, Dalane W.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Cardiol Sect, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [High, Kevin P.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Infect Dis Sect, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA",Wake Forest University Claude D.

In this article, we document several ethical, legal, and social challenges associated with the commercialization of human microbiome research, focusing particularly on how this research is mobilized within economic markets for new public health uses. Methods: We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews (2009-2010) with 63 scientists, researchers, and National Institutes of Health project leaders (""investigators"") involved with human microbiome research. Interviews explored a range of ethical, legal, and social dimensions of human microbiome research, including investigators' perspectives on commercialization. Using thematic content analysis, we identified and analyzed emergent themes and patterns. Results: Investigators discussed the commercialization of human microbiome research in terms of (1) commercialization, probiotics, and issues of safety, (2) public awareness of the benefits and risks of dietary supplements, and (3) regulation. Conclusion: The prevailing theme of ethical, legal, social concern focused on the need to find a balance between the marketplace, scientific research, and the public's health. The themes we identified are intended to serve as points for discussions about the relationship between scientific research and the manufacture and distribution of over-the-counter dietary supplements in the United States.","[Slashinski, Melody J.; Achenbaum, Laura S.; McGuire, Amy L.] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [McCurdy, Sheryl A.] Univ Texas Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Promot & Prevent Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Whitney, Simon N.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Family & Community Med, Houston, TX 77098 USA","National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [R01HG004853]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute: Grant #R01HG004853.

All metazoan organisms organisms that we can see with the naked eye exist in lifelong partnerships with vast microbial communities. These ""microbiomes"" supply metazoans with essential life processes that are not encoded in nonmicrobial genomes. Recent work in microbiology has revealed that microbes, like metazoans, have specific body plans and sensory systems, that they can communicate with each other, and that they orchestrate collective behaviors. Investigations of these ancient yet enduring processes are uncovering the fundamental design principles of life. Microbes are also storehouses of new molecules, biochemical pathways, and materials with medical, industrial, and agricultural relevance.

The refractory nature of early overweight necessitates identifying the factors contributing to early excess weight gain for successful intervention. Early feeding practices may be particularly important in shaping long-term vulnerability to obesity. How and what infants are fed can influence weight gain, adiposity, and energy metabolism during infancy and across the life course through a number of interacting physiological and behavioral pathways. This article argues that these biological mechanisms interact with the social and behavioral context of infant feeding to create differential vulnerability to later obesity. Methods: This article reviews recent research on the potential mechanisms linking infant feeding and risk of later obesity, focusing on the emerging role of microflora colonization. Results: The nutritive and non-nutritive components of breastmilk, formula and solid foods and the practices surrounding feeding shape the infant metabolome, programming growth rates and body composition, altering metabolism and physiology, promoting differential microfloral colonization, and shaping behavioral responses to foods and eating. Conclusion: The occurrence of chronic disease precursors at increasingly younger ages and the tendency of overweight young children to become overweight adolescents and adults underscore the importance of understanding this complex early exposure and intervening early to prevent the development of obesity in increasingly weight-promoting environments.

Discussion: The human microbiome is the entire complement of microorganisms that exists in and on every human body. Currently most biobanks focus primarily on human tissues and/or associated data (e. g. health records). Accordingly, most discussions in the social sciences and humanities on these issues are focused (appropriately so) on the implications of biobanks and sharing data derived from human tissues. However, rapid advances in human microbiome research involve collecting large amounts of data on microorganisms that exist in symbiotic relationships with the human body. Currently it is not clear whether these microorganisms should be considered part of or separate from the human body. Arguments can be made for both, but ultimately it seems that the dichotomy of human versus non-human and self versus non-self inevitably breaks down in this context. This situation has the potential to add further complications to debates on biobanking. Summary: In this paper, we revisit some of the core problem areas of privacy, consent, ownership, return of results, governance, and benefit sharing, and consider how they might be impacted upon by human microbiome research. Some of the issues discussed also have relevance to other forms of microbial research. Discussion of these themes is guided by conceptual analysis of microbiome research and interviews with leading Canadian scientists in the field.","[O'Doherty, Kieran C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hawkins, Alice K.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Eth, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada","CIHRCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [200808CHM, 193095]","We would like to thank Liz Wilcox, Jayme Taylor and Tamara Ibrahim for valuable assistance in project and data management, as well as expert advice from Petra Arck, Michael Burgess, and Steven Hallam.

As nurses have a depth of expertise in these areas, they will make a significant contribution toward better understanding the role of the microbiome in disease, and how to manipulate the microbiome to advantage patients toward health. This article describes the human microbiome and why it is important to overall health and disease.

Because these microbes are mostly vertically transmitted, they have evolved within each human group and provide a view of human ancestry. In particular, we discuss using Helicobacter pylori as a marker of ancestry and migrations. Other organisms with more mixed vertical and horizontal transmission are not suitable to trace migrations with any fidelity. Human mixing affects microbial phylogeographic signals, and lifestyles impact the human microbiome population structure. A decade after the human genome was sequenced, we are gaining insights into the population structure of the human microbiome. We also examine whether, rather than focus on the genetics of single microbial populations, a wider approach to the study of human ancestry based on the human microbiome is now possible.","[Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Dept Med, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Dept Microbiol, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,20,,2011,40,,10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145711,Anthropology

Homeostatic and nonhomeostatic neural controls of energy predispose people to obesity, and this predisposition may be exaggerated by the influence of media, marketing, and sleep patterns. Epigenetic gene regulation may account for the influence of modifiable early life or maternal exposures on obesity risk. Alterations in gut flora caused by infant feeding practices or later diet may influence the absorption and storage of energy.
