### Problem and objective

**Question:** what are the trends in research and media coverage with respect to 
the human microbiome - and what do these suggest about how this issue will evolve 
over the next 5-10 years? 

The aim is to build a tool to summarise these trends, to inform the new horizon 
scanning process.

The microbiome is being used here as a test case. It is hoped that the tool 
could be extended to other topics of interest in the future - and other use cases.

### Features of the proposed tool

**1. Fetch and store metadata about relevant articles**

* Find and ingest a research backlog - what has been happening in this area over the last 5-10 years?
  + Populate metadata from manually retrieved list 
  + Carry out keyword/title searches (PloS, Crossref) 

* Ongoing monitoring and automated updating - regular updates of new research in this area
  + Retrieve articles from alert/ToC emails 
  + Perform scheduled searches

### Features of the proposed tool

**2. Create useful metrics**

* Volume of research - is this a growing/fading issue, prominence of sub-categories 

* Who is producing this research and what themes/topics can be identified 

* Presence of key entities – companies, places, researchers, products 

* Distinguishing between medical and food related research

### Features of the proposed tool

**3. Deliver results to the user**

* User-friendly dashboard that can be understood by users across the agency 

* Visualizes the metrics with interactive filtering options

* Returns list of references relevant to identified trends 

* Timeline showing when trends change or emerge to help project into the future

### The microbiome test case and future use cases

* Manually retrieved references (from Web of Science), time horizon 
searches of two databases (PLoS and Crossref), and references scraped from 
email alerts (*Google Scholar*, *Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry*, *Microbiome*, 
*Cell*, *Gut* and *Scientific Reports*)

* Future use cases
  + setting up further test cases (and monitoring them)
  + uploading a list of DOIs and using the tool to visualise your literature
  + 'instant' search of key databases and visualisation of results

### Demo

[The Shiny App is now deloyed online](https://foodstandards.shinyapps.io/hstestcase/)

### Features of the proposed tool - progress

**1. Fetch and store metadata about relevant articles**

* Find and ingest a research backlog - what has been happening in this area over the last 5-10 years?
  + Populate metadata from manually retrieved list - *YES*
  + Carry out keyword/title searches (PloS, Crossref) - *YES but want to expand to PubMed and others*

* Ongoing monitoring and automated updating - regular updates of new research in this area
  + Retrieve articles from alert/ToC emails - *YES*
  + Perform scheduled searches - *NOT YET!*

<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

### Features of the proposed tool

**2. Create useful metrics**

* Volume of research - is this a growing/fading issue, prominence of sub-categories - *YES for whole database NOT YET for sub-topics*

* Who is producing this research and what themes/topics can be identified - *YES although better text cleaning would improve this*

* Presence of key entities – companies, places, researchers, products - *NOT YET*

* Distinguishing between medical and food related research - *PARTIALLY*


<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

### Next steps

* Remainder of this phase
  + storage and automation
  + text cleaning
  
* Next stage
